WEBVTT

00:00:03.258 --> 00:00:04.978
<v Arnab Roy>We'll come to that thing later on 1st.</v>

00:00:04.978 --> 00:00:08.489
For now,
I'll just go with the flow that has been

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:13.263
initially done and from there I'll next
I'll go to the first phase,

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:18.809
which is that is that is the onboarding
of the doctors syncing of profiles and

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:21.898
you know going from Hu to th that part,
OK.

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:29.065
So now basically if we start from here,
this is how it goes now considering you

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:30.818
<v Arnab Roy>know for a fresh doctor.</v>

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:35.845
So right now I'll I'll come to that part
later on where Hu doctors come on to for

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:40.008
now just considering it's a fresh you
know login from the user side.

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:41.938
<v Arnab Roy>We again have those same things.</v>

00:00:43.858 --> 00:00:45.058
<v Arnab Roy>This this home page.</v>

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:46.378
<v Arnab Roy>I have redesigned it again.</v>

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:47.658
<v Arnab Roy>There's a different edition.</v>

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:51.318
I'll show it later, but for now,
just for navigation's sake,

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:52.698
<v Arnab Roy>I'm going with this so.</v>

00:00:54.418 --> 00:00:57.758
This is how the home page is.
Basically we show what we offer,

00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:58.818
<v Arnab Roy>we show the process.</v>

00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:01.058
<v Arnab Roy>Of going through the.</v>

00:01:03.018 --> 00:01:09.221
Of going through the the steps basically
of medical tourism and then we have some

00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:13.608
testimonials and we call the hospitals
partners out here.

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:15.928
<v Arnab Roy>So this is how we do it.</v>

00:01:15.928 --> 00:01:21.363
Now the this would be the first home page
and then we get into the another main

00:01:21.363 --> 00:01:23.808
<v Arnab Roy>navigation. There are the hospitals.</v>

00:01:24.408 --> 00:01:25.288
<v Arnab Roy>So now we have.</v>

00:01:26.858 --> 00:01:30.405
This is how it looks like.
We always have a featured hospital right

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:34.265
in the beginning, and whichever,
whichever has the highest ratings or the

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:37.759
top doctors based on that,
we kind of give a small snippet of that

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:38.698
<v Arnab Roy>featured hospital.</v>

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.538
<v Arnab Roy>This is like an add banner kind of thing.</v>

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:42.778
<v Arnab Roy>Things will change within this.</v>

00:01:42.778 --> 00:01:44.218
<v Arnab Roy>I've just kept space out here.</v>

00:01:44.218 --> 00:01:46.608
<v Arnab Roy>This is not really a design thing.</v>

00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:50.248
<v Arnab Roy>This is just so ARPANET suggested.</v>

00:01:50.248 --> 00:01:52.631
You know,
keep some space open for potential ads

00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:53.408
<v Arnab Roy>and all to come.</v>

00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:55.008
<v Arnab Roy>So that is just that.</v>

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:57.940
And then again,
we have our list of partners for the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.448
<v Arnab Roy>hospitals.</v>

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:01.697
Ideally,
a user would know look someone looking

00:02:01.697 --> 00:02:05.206
for the hospital would go through the
list of partners,

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:10.220
get into it and this would they would see
like basically what that hospital is.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.171
So out here we have just an example.
Medicare Hospital we have the information

00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:16.048
<v Arnab Roy>we have their.</v>

00:02:16.048 --> 00:02:16.528
<v Arnab Roy>Booking process.</v>

00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:19.658
Popular treatment options within that
hospital.

00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:23.098
<v Arnab Roy>Another you know, three USPS.</v>

00:02:23.258 --> 00:02:24.418
<v Arnab Roy>Again, this is an add banner.</v>

00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:28.147
Uh, you you have multiple, you know,
filters,

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:32.328
which you can go through into in order to
search for your correct treatment.

00:02:32.888 --> 00:02:37.127
We also have an R history,
kind of a deal with, you know,

00:02:37.127 --> 00:02:38.808
<v Arnab Roy>video slots and images.</v>

00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:43.943
Our specialties in treatment,
what is that specific institution famous

00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:45.808
<v Arnab Roy>for in terms of treatment?</v>

00:02:46.048 --> 00:02:49.326
So we do that as well and since this is
medical,

00:02:49.326 --> 00:02:54.277
you know it's it's a medical tourism side.
We're focusing a lot on actual

00:02:54.277 --> 00:02:57.488
photographs of doctors and the hospital
itself.

00:02:57.488 --> 00:03:03.204
So we have kind of a gallery gallery
section out here to show various kinds of,

00:03:03.204 --> 00:03:08.348
you know, treatments and things that,
that, that the hospital provides.

00:03:08.998 --> 00:03:13.749
We also have a little snippet about the
city that the hospital is situated in,

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:17.838
like a map address or something because
people are coming from far.

00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:19.848
To a certain country in order to get
treatment,

00:03:19.848 --> 00:03:20.088
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:25.698
they should know what that country or
that city has or what it is.

00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:28.648
This layout of the website I'm saying
this is actually aligned to the original

00:03:28.648 --> 00:03:29.048
<v Arnab Roy>Pardon.</v>

00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:35.598
<v Richa Kapoor >layout that we agreed upon.</v>

00:03:35.918 --> 00:03:38.798
<v Richa Kapoor >I just had a question on on the homepage.</v>

00:03:39.348 --> 00:03:39.468
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:45.871
So let's say let's take an take a
hypothetical situation of someone being

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:46.168
sick in one,
and that person probably has a heart

00:03:46.168 --> 00:03:46.288
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:03:50.056 --> 00:03:51.478
<v Richa Kapoor >related issue or.</v>

00:03:51.918 --> 00:03:52.388
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm, OK.</v>

00:03:52.388 --> 00:03:56.102
A kidney related issue and when they land
on the homepage,

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.738
<v Richa Kapoor >let's say they've Googled.</v>

00:03:59.308 --> 00:04:06.284
Best heart surgeons in India or Best
Heart surgeon in Delhi or how to take

00:04:06.284 --> 00:04:08.878
heart this thing organically someone
searching.

00:04:08.878 --> 00:04:08.998
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:04:10.828 --> 00:04:15.548
So what is it that our home page answers
that?

00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:21.812
Or has so that people actually land up on
our website and then rest of The thing is

00:04:21.812 --> 00:04:23.188
<v Richa Kapoor >more navigational, where people start to.</v>

00:04:23.188 --> 00:04:25.028
<v Arnab Roy>I'll try through keywords OK.</v>

00:04:25.308 --> 00:04:29.948
So from that I have a second version of
the homepage.

00:04:29.948 --> 00:04:31.198
As I said,
the homepage is not actually what I had

00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:31.358
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:32.468
<v Arnab Roy>in mind.</v>

00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:36.028
<v Arnab Roy>So this would be the redesigned homepage.</v>

00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:36.768
So basically I'm trying to add more
things out here so that through,

00:04:36.768 --> 00:04:37.048
<v Richa Kapoor >OK.</v>

00:04:39.878 --> 00:04:43.460
as you said, via keywords,
they're gonna be coming on landing onto

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.668
this page right when they search for the
specific keywords.

00:04:47.028 --> 00:04:51.348
So somewhere within within this area I
can put in like specialize in.

00:04:51.668 --> 00:04:54.823
So Isma, as you said,
related to cardiology,

00:04:54.823 --> 00:05:00.502
may probably he can go through it or it
can land here because if if it's if he's

00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:04.569
going very specific,
then we'll land him directly onto a,

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.584
you know,
a specific hospitals or the most

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:10.278
<v Arnab Roy>recommended hospitals, cardiology section.</v>

00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:11.238
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:15.490
So the because the based on my
discussions with Arpan and I think it's

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.918
similar because Arnab,
you were also part of those discussions

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:18.118
<v Arnab Roy>Mm hmm.</v>

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.655
in the home page has to tell them that,
OK,

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.358
India is a great destination for any
disease that you have.

00:05:23.358 --> 00:05:23.478
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:26.668
<v Richa Kapoor >You probably might want to.</v>

00:05:26.668 --> 00:05:29.788
Talk about cosmetology and aesthetics as
well.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:29.988
<v Arnab Roy>Mm hmm.</v>

00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:34.542
Other than that,
then when he comes on the home page,

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.038
<v Richa Kapoor >he should be able to see successful.</v>

00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:39.698
<v Richa Kapoor >Cases of or successful case studies of.</v>

00:05:39.698 --> 00:05:40.258
<v Arnab Roy>No, not.</v>

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:45.242
So The thing is, we might not be able to,
you know,

00:05:45.242 --> 00:05:48.478
exactly give all the keywords for them to
land on the home page.

00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:52.560
I'm not sorry, sorry.
I was not telling you to do keywords,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.001
but probably from a messaging or what
positioning standpoint that the person at

00:05:58.001 --> 00:06:03.171
some point in your on your home page
should be able to see examples of such

00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:05.128
happy customers.
People who have come from far off.

00:06:05.128 --> 00:06:05.248
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:06:06.878 --> 00:06:09.308
And they were able to get their treatment
done other than testimonials, or however,

00:06:09.308 --> 00:06:11.468
<v Arnab Roy>Testimonials yes.</v>

00:06:12.263 --> 00:06:17.198
maybe one card carousal kind of a thing
where people see that. OK then then.

00:06:17.948 --> 00:06:22.138
Somewhere on the home page it should be
able to tell that it's up end to end.

00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:24.658
<v Richa Kapoor >Full support, kind of a company.</v>

00:06:24.658 --> 00:06:26.858
It's not something where we are just
telling you, OK, OK.

00:06:26.858 --> 00:06:30.418
We'll be a bridge between you and them,
but probably if you just want a if you

00:06:30.418 --> 00:06:30.538
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:35.115
want consultation.
If you want somebody to talk,

00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:39.178
if you want some help on planning your
itinerary, if you want.

00:06:39.878 --> 00:06:40.788
Hmm. See The thing is Richa,
we we have that thing of.

00:06:40.788 --> 00:06:42.708
<v Richa Kapoor >You know you. So we do.</v>

00:06:44.248 --> 00:06:48.888
That's why we have another I I wanna say
player another another user called the

00:06:48.888 --> 00:06:50.048
<v Arnab Roy>Medical Coordinator.</v>

00:06:50.048 --> 00:06:54.420
So once a person gets into those search
bars and all of a hospital and all and

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.138
searches first thing, once he's ready for,
you know,

00:06:55.138 --> 00:06:55.378
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:06:57.354 --> 00:07:00.010
of of a booking or a consultation or
something,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.168
<v Arnab Roy>we'll assign him a medical coordinator.</v>

00:07:02.448 --> 00:07:02.978
Who would then actually assist him in
exactly what he needs so,

00:07:02.978 --> 00:07:03.218
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:07:06.882 --> 00:07:07.468
<v Arnab Roy>but that that part, I don't know.</v>

00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:07.828
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:07:09.168 --> 00:07:11.488
That part,
I think it's a little far off right now.

00:07:11.488 --> 00:07:15.429
I'm still trying to, you know,
streamline the coordinator part, doctors,

00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:15.608
<v Arnab Roy>hospitals, that is understood.</v>

00:07:15.608 --> 00:07:16.088
<v Richa Kapoor >OK.</v>

00:07:17.858 --> 00:07:20.708
Onboarding doctors, onboarding hospitals,
having the treatment options,

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:21.618
<v Arnab Roy>those things are clear.</v>

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:27.629
But there is a there is like which part
do we exactly pay for medical

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:32.252
coordinator's help?
Or is it something which we can give free

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:35.608
for once and then they resume paying for
it?

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:37.978
<v Arnab Roy>I'm a little.</v>

00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:41.080
I yeah,
that is something that we can probably

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.096
initially for the first something we
might nominally charge for that person

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:47.598
because he's a cost or we build that cost
up in our overall package irrespective of

00:07:47.598 --> 00:07:47.718
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.458
that that needs to be because language
itself is a barrier, someone who.

00:07:56.458 --> 00:07:57.098
Coming from interiors of Africa might not
even be able to speak English so.

00:07:57.098 --> 00:07:57.298
<v Arnab Roy>Mm hmm.</v>

00:08:01.318 --> 00:08:03.723
So for yeah for that for that we have
something.

00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:04.538
So in a in a specific hospital because
you said of course medical,

00:08:04.538 --> 00:08:04.778
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:08:07.012 --> 00:08:09.318
tourism and language becomes a barrier,
right.

00:08:09.918 --> 00:08:12.947
Sometimes.
So we kind of for when a person,

00:08:12.947 --> 00:08:17.834
this is what what I came into.
So when a person gets into the hospital

00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:21.620
page and he goes,
we directly don't connect him to us.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.188
The doctor first we get a basic inquiry
information from him that is.

00:08:24.188 --> 00:08:24.348
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:08:27.218 --> 00:08:28.898
<v Arnab Roy>Describing the basic medical condition.</v>

00:08:28.898 --> 00:08:33.098
So this all this data is actually for the
coordinator, not not the doctor. Huh.

00:08:33.098 --> 00:08:34.628
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah, I'm just. Yeah, I'm just.</v>

00:08:34.628 --> 00:08:35.668
<v Arnab Roy>For the coordinators.</v>

00:08:37.098 --> 00:08:39.926
But all of I see.
I'm also able to just see many parts of

00:08:39.926 --> 00:08:42.217
your.
Those were the thoughts which I I'm just

00:08:42.217 --> 00:08:44.898
validating with you that they've gotten
captured here.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:48.448
Secondly,
the person should be able to filter

00:08:48.448 --> 00:08:53.778
hospitals or doctors based on either the
disease or his preferred city sometimes.

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:59.708
Sometimes, after recommendation of their,
the Doctor Who's handling them there,

00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:02.868
they say they might say that, OK,
you only go to Chennai.

00:09:03.578 --> 00:09:05.438
That's where you will get the best
service. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that.

00:09:05.438 --> 00:09:08.798
So that's why we have we have these
filter sections out here basically.

00:09:09.038 --> 00:09:13.807
So it it'll geographical locations like
experiences of the doctor's roles,

00:09:13.807 --> 00:09:17.049
the expertise,
and maybe there might be a language

00:09:17.049 --> 00:09:18.228
change out here,
but we would we will give them multiple

00:09:18.228 --> 00:09:18.388
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:09:20.673 --> 00:09:25.886
filters so that they can pinpoint based
on geographical location based on doctors

00:09:25.886 --> 00:09:28.238
<v Arnab Roy>based on treatment options and based.</v>

00:09:28.238 --> 00:09:30.358
<v Arnab Roy>On specialties that a doctor might have.</v>

00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:31.258
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:34.578
OK, so based on that,
only he gets into a certain.

00:09:36.338 --> 00:09:39.458
<v Arnab Roy>He gets the, you know, list of hospitals.</v>

00:09:40.548 --> 00:09:41.138
<v Richa Kapoor >Ticket and.</v>

00:09:41.138 --> 00:09:45.451
It populate populates based on that and
from there once he books out here for the

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:48.502
medical coordinator,
we grab some information that is the

00:09:48.502 --> 00:09:50.658
<v Arnab Roy>basic medical condition estimated budget.</v>

00:09:52.088 --> 00:09:52.368
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:09:52.378 --> 00:09:55.858
And regarding the languages local
languages known of where I'm going.

00:09:56.758 --> 00:09:57.378
Local languages of the location that I'm
trying to go, so select language is known.

00:09:57.378 --> 00:09:59.898
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:10:00.678 --> 00:10:04.985
Common spoken languages in that country,
whether I need a translator or not,

00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:06.718
<v Arnab Roy>I can actually ticket out here.</v>

00:10:07.308 --> 00:10:10.245
So then probably,
you know translating service or something

00:10:10.245 --> 00:10:11.028
<v Arnab Roy>can be provided.</v>

00:10:11.948 --> 00:10:12.018
Still, I'm a little sketchy on that,
but I feel this is something which is

00:10:12.018 --> 00:10:12.258
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:18.812
needed.
We people might need services over

00:10:18.812 --> 00:10:19.098
translator now whether we put that
headache on the hospital's head or we

00:10:19.098 --> 00:10:19.258
<v Richa Kapoor >OK.</v>

00:10:23.058 --> 00:10:26.374
kind of provided ourselves,
I'm not really sure on that.

00:10:26.374 --> 00:10:27.188
<v Arnab Roy>That is a bus.</v>

00:10:27.188 --> 00:10:28.948
<v Arnab Roy>Decision probably you guys can take it.</v>

00:10:30.518 --> 00:10:31.558
<v Arnab Roy>Are you coming alone?</v>

00:10:31.718 --> 00:10:35.435
We take that information as well,
whether that person is arriving alone.

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:38.642
If there are people. So in this case,
since the answer is yes,

00:10:38.642 --> 00:10:40.678
<v Arnab Roy>enter details of people coming with you.</v>

00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:44.013
So we kind of so we so based on all this
information,

00:10:44.013 --> 00:10:47.779
if I'm booking for someone else also the
inquiry form opens for some,

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:51.814
some other person based on this.
Once I submit this thing kind of comes up

00:10:51.814 --> 00:10:54.988
where our hospital coordinator will get
in touch with you.

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:57.565
Again,
this is a language thing where you wanna

00:10:57.565 --> 00:10:57.828
<v Arnab Roy>keep it.</v>

00:10:57.828 --> 00:11:00.298
Medical coordinator or hospital
coordinator.

00:11:00.298 --> 00:11:00.578
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:11:01.508 --> 00:11:03.388
<v Arnab Roy>It's it's like business choice.</v>

00:11:03.388 --> 00:11:06.668
We'll get in touch with you within 48
hours after reviewing your request.

00:11:06.668 --> 00:11:08.804
'Cause,
we will give some time to the medical

00:11:08.804 --> 00:11:10.428
<v Arnab Roy>coordinators to get the plan ready.</v>

00:11:11.028 --> 00:11:14.626
Plan as in quotation and a medical
itinerary and all those things.

00:11:14.626 --> 00:11:15.818
So out here we have mentioned metric
coordinator will assist you with medical

00:11:15.818 --> 00:11:16.258
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:20.748
<v Arnab Roy>consultations, scheduling your trip.</v>

00:11:21.558 --> 00:11:25.008
And getting a quote.
After that I drop into this main,

00:11:25.008 --> 00:11:26.638
<v Arnab Roy>but I won't show this now.</v>

00:11:26.638 --> 00:11:27.078
<v Arnab Roy>One second.</v>

00:11:27.078 --> 00:11:28.838
<v Arnab Roy>First I want to show like.</v>

00:11:32.008 --> 00:11:33.288
<v Arnab Roy>I want to go to the main navigation.</v>

00:11:33.288 --> 00:11:36.158
After that I'll show like what happens
when a person actually goes through the

00:11:36.158 --> 00:11:36.448
<v Arnab Roy>process.</v>

00:11:36.768 --> 00:11:41.607
So first navigation was the home page.
Then we we have the hospitals,

00:11:41.607 --> 00:11:44.648
hospitals itself.
Then we have the doctors.

00:11:44.648 --> 00:11:49.248
Again, it's the same, same, same design,
but out here it is.

00:11:49.248 --> 00:11:53.759
The focus is on the doctors of that
specific hospital, so featured Dr.

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:56.808
this person affiliated hospital,
this hospital.

00:11:57.598 --> 00:11:59.918
So it's like vice versa,
I can go in via doctor search for

00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:00.358
<v Richa Kapoor >OK.</v>

00:12:01.235 --> 00:12:03.738
hospital or via hospital search for
Doctor User's Choice again and we have.

00:12:03.738 --> 00:12:03.978
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:12:07.478 --> 00:12:09.318
Top doctors,
top rated doctors and all things.

00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:13.918
Again,
this this is another major part of it now

00:12:13.918 --> 00:12:16.718
from here also I can go to a doctor's
profile.

00:12:17.268 --> 00:12:22.548
Now this doctor's profile is treatment
dot hospitals doctor profile, not H use.

00:12:23.528 --> 00:12:23.848
<v Richa Kapoor >Right.</v>

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:27.541
So, but it could be the same thing. Also,
when Hu guys port out here,

00:12:27.541 --> 00:12:28.958
<v Arnab Roy>all that information carries.</v>

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:33.208
But I think this could be a replication
of the profile page that you have on.

00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:35.628
Replication,
but there are certain few changes.

00:12:35.628 --> 00:12:37.548
<v Richa Kapoor >You answer like the rating and all.</v>

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:37.908
I I would also say that probably what
I've seen on other global websites is

00:12:37.908 --> 00:12:38.028
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:12:42.135 --> 00:12:44.428
<v Richa Kapoor >that if either hospital or the doctor.</v>

00:12:45.408 --> 00:12:45.528
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:50.078
They generally give out a range of
treatment, like money, once in dollars.

00:12:51.758 --> 00:12:55.078
If you are let for it,
it just generally disease specific.

00:12:55.558 --> 00:12:59.094
Let's say if someone's coming for a
kidney transplant.

00:12:59.094 --> 00:13:02.436
So what is the kind of money that he
should expect?

00:13:02.436 --> 00:13:06.678
Shelling out only on his treatment,
not stay, not travel and all?

00:13:07.188 --> 00:13:10.638
But it's a range is mentioned.
I think one of the biggest deciding

00:13:10.638 --> 00:13:11.668
<v Richa Kapoor >factor is also that.</v>

00:13:11.898 --> 00:13:13.918
So range matlab.
So out here $400 is really you're saying.

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:17.082
This is basically why.
Why I'm telling you this is because Arpan

00:13:17.082 --> 00:13:17.958
<v Richa Kapoor >wanted to play on.</v>

00:13:20.878 --> 00:13:24.756
All these Madonna's Portis and big
hospitals of the world,

00:13:24.756 --> 00:13:29.883
they have their own medical touts who are
sitting in that country and sending

00:13:29.883 --> 00:13:33.563
people to them.
So but smaller hospitals like Columbia,

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:38.624
Asia but were big enough to handle
international tourism but do not have the

00:13:38.624 --> 00:13:39.478
<v Richa Kapoor >probably the.</v>

00:13:39.478 --> 00:13:42.078
Money and the mind to market themselves
to overseas.

00:13:42.078 --> 00:13:43.718
<v Arnab Roy>Structure. They don't have actually, huh?</v>

00:13:44.428 --> 00:13:47.900
So then the only advantage of such such
hospital,

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:53.524
not that they have a star rated doctor,
but they have equal treatment kind of or

00:13:53.524 --> 00:13:58.037
equalent kind of capability.
However they can offer you a better

00:13:58.037 --> 00:13:59.558
pricing as compared to these five star
hospitals.

00:13:59.558 --> 00:13:59.838
<v Arnab Roy>So.</v>

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:04.308
<v Richa Kapoor >So playing up on the price.</v>

00:14:04.308 --> 00:14:07.028
That hum such there will have to come,
but.

00:14:08.718 --> 00:14:10.998
I am the cheapest.
I I charge you the lowest.

00:14:11.158 --> 00:14:11.708
But what we can say is that you know
something like this in a London in a in a

00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:12.468
<v Arnab Roy>Nene. Ha.</v>

00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:17.868
<v Richa Kapoor >Europe or a US would like, let's say call.</v>

00:14:17.868 --> 00:14:20.728
So you're saying we,
we are justifying the price by giving

00:14:20.728 --> 00:14:22.071
<v Richa Kapoor >That's right, you are.</v>

00:14:22.071 --> 00:14:22.128
some sort of comparison compared to this
compared to this treatment in $50,

00:14:22.128 --> 00:14:25.408
<v Richa Kapoor >Then let's say I treat my leg this way.</v>

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.484
<v Richa Kapoor >Would cost you $100,000.</v>

00:14:27.484 --> 00:14:28.168
<v Arnab Roy>000 a $100,000 but in India?</v>

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:31.685
Yeah, but in India,
and especially with people like us,

00:14:31.685 --> 00:14:34.208
it is probably 20,
000 or something like that, so.

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:36.608
<v Arnab Roy>Tofir tofir yejo yeja bolio.</v>

00:14:36.608 --> 00:14:37.528
<v Arnab Roy>That's good.</v>

00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:41.925
I think we should add this in the
hospital's profile in in case of

00:14:41.925 --> 00:14:45.846
treatment or hospital,
so when we get into the main hospitals

00:14:45.846 --> 00:14:49.008
page of a specific hospital,
then I guess we can.

00:14:49.008 --> 00:14:55.248
Oh ****, this link got broken.
So in in this page somewhere out here.

00:14:56.798 --> 00:14:59.098
Or near their popular treatment options,
we can.

00:14:59.098 --> 00:14:59.401
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Generally, yeah.</v>

00:14:59.401 --> 00:15:03.118
We can give that state statistic that
what you are talking about key.

00:15:03.988 --> 00:15:09.458
That's what I saw in most of the websites.
They they had it along with that,

00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:11.588
<v Richa Kapoor >probably good to have kind of.</v>

00:15:14.638 --> 00:15:18.435
I'll tell you how I'll do it.
I think instead of keeping a separate

00:15:18.435 --> 00:15:19.998
<v Arnab Roy>section i'mlod, I's like so.</v>

00:15:20.198 --> 00:15:21.318
<v Arnab Roy>So this is the doctor, right?</v>

00:15:21.318 --> 00:15:22.258
<v Arnab Roy>Doctor, this this side may feature.</v>

00:15:22.258 --> 00:15:22.418
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:15:23.998 --> 00:15:24.838
<v Arnab Roy>You must have seen it.</v>

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:27.118
The same thing happening in Hu right
where we the first booking consultation.

00:15:27.118 --> 00:15:27.478
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:15:28.614 --> 00:15:31.518
Now below that we have something called
Doctor Specialties.

00:15:31.718 --> 00:15:35.128
What that specific doctor's specializes
in? So out here? Meh.

00:15:35.128 --> 00:15:35.608
If I hover over cardiology,
I'm getting a little bit more information,

00:15:35.608 --> 00:15:35.888
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:15:39.033 --> 00:15:39.198
<v Arnab Roy>no?</v>

00:15:39.198 --> 00:15:42.964
So out here I can put that range thing
which you are mentioning along with the

00:15:42.964 --> 00:15:45.680
basic information.
I can also put a range thing and then

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.016
inquire now so that when a person hovers
over any specific specialty,

00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:51.828
they will get to know, OK, OK,
cardiology treatment in us.

00:15:53.068 --> 00:15:55.928
Generally comes to this much that,
but this treatment in India at this

00:15:55.928 --> 00:15:56.168
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:15:57.656 --> 00:16:00.628
location would cost you near about this
much.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:02.928
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah, that's the idea.</v>

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:03.368
<v Arnab Roy>So in.</v>

00:16:04.008 --> 00:16:04.888
<v Arnab Roy>All right.</v>

00:16:05.128 --> 00:16:06.968
<v Arnab Roy>I just just one second.</v>

00:16:06.968 --> 00:16:08.208
<v Arnab Roy>I PEN paper that.</v>

00:16:11.598 --> 00:16:12.278
<v Arnab Roy>Just one second.</v>

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:13.038
<v Arnab Roy>I just.</v>

00:16:14.728 --> 00:16:15.368
<v Arnab Roy>Show this.</v>

00:16:15.548 --> 00:16:17.616
And also just a general medicine,
whatever,

00:16:17.616 --> 00:16:19.308
<v Richa Kapoor >when you're talking about specialty?</v>

00:16:19.428 --> 00:16:21.648
Another thing that that was there was and
I.

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:24.789
I would need some help.
I would need some help from you guys for

00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:25.368
<v Arnab Roy>some things.</v>

00:16:25.368 --> 00:16:26.908
<v Arnab Roy>That is the speciality.</v>

00:16:26.908 --> 00:16:28.308
<v Richa Kapoor >That if you could lift them up.</v>

00:16:29.438 --> 00:16:30.838
<v Arnab Roy>Specialties and treatments like how.</v>

00:16:30.838 --> 00:16:34.574
What is the exact categorization like
like even I can do it but probably you

00:16:34.574 --> 00:16:35.138
<v Arnab Roy>guys would have a better grasp.</v>

00:16:35.138 --> 00:16:36.978
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah, ideally arnab.</v>

00:16:37.058 --> 00:16:39.491
Yeah,
ideally because they're trying to pull

00:16:39.491 --> 00:16:41.058
<v Richa Kapoor >people to a specific country.</v>

00:16:41.298 --> 00:16:44.811
Ideally,
what would make sense is without with his

00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:49.838
qualification and his speciality,
et cetera, if he could generally have,

00:16:49.838 --> 00:16:54.658
because then generally have X number of
surgeries conducted. So what?

00:16:54.658 --> 00:16:58.397
Especially even we were if we were to
look for a doctor, we would say, OK,

00:16:58.397 --> 00:17:01.338
I want to go to a gynecologist who has at
least delivered.

00:17:02.198 --> 00:17:02.378
<v Richa Kapoor >1000 babies and that.</v>

00:17:02.378 --> 00:17:05.128
OK,
you're talking about those those meter

00:17:05.128 --> 00:17:05.338
those number meters,
which runs like in this for this specific

00:17:05.338 --> 00:17:09.157
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah, yeah, yeah, but yeah.</v>

00:17:09.157 --> 00:17:10.888
<v Arnab Roy>doctor, he has conducted 445 surgeries 3.</v>

00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:14.368
So he has about X number of years of
experience, etc.

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:16.888
Because other than that,
because he's a surgeon.

00:17:16.888 --> 00:17:20.798
Because he's if you go for second
opinions also like most of the people for

00:17:20.798 --> 00:17:20.876
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:17:20.876 --> 00:17:23.814
that prognosis might not actually come
for a treatment,

00:17:23.814 --> 00:17:25.808
<v Richa Kapoor >but might want to take our opinion so.</v>

00:17:27.518 --> 00:17:30.838
<v Richa Kapoor >Then they say expertise surgery.</v>

00:17:30.838 --> 00:17:32.718
<v Richa Kapoor >Then they say OK, X number of years.</v>

00:17:34.358 --> 00:17:36.878
And X number of things done done
successfully.

00:17:36.878 --> 00:17:41.638
I'm talking of low end diseases also like
hernia, prostate and all that.

00:17:42.238 --> 00:17:43.598
Track record you want.
Basically the doctor's track record to be

00:17:43.598 --> 00:17:45.052
<v Richa Kapoor >Yep, Yep. Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:17:45.052 --> 00:17:45.918
<v Arnab Roy>mentioned here. Wow.</v>

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:48.038
<v Richa Kapoor >And that has to be done upfront.</v>

00:17:49.158 --> 00:17:52.409
So that will come pretty much on the top
only after this only.

00:17:52.409 --> 00:17:53.918
I'll put that band of tracker tracking
numbers and then the web team can

00:17:53.918 --> 00:17:54.118
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:59.116
probably make it make it like it it
whenever we come in,

00:17:59.116 --> 00:18:01.798
we kind of tracks from zero to 100 or
whatever the.

00:18:01.798 --> 00:18:02.758
<v Arnab Roy>Number counter moves.</v>

00:18:02.758 --> 00:18:05.438
It's it's something which is already
present.

00:18:05.558 --> 00:18:06.798
<v Arnab Roy>It's OK, I understood.</v>

00:18:07.678 --> 00:18:10.758
<v Arnab Roy>So all right, based on that, yeah.</v>

00:18:12.638 --> 00:18:14.318
<v Arnab Roy>I'll do this few changes out here.</v>

00:18:16.038 --> 00:18:20.037
Making sure that the doctor's track
record is also shown along with the price

00:18:20.037 --> 00:18:21.928
range of the treatment compared to other
first world countries.

00:18:21.928 --> 00:18:22.128
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:18:24.388 --> 00:18:24.508
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:18:24.508 --> 00:18:25.508
<v Arnab Roy>So yeah, again.</v>

00:18:25.548 --> 00:18:29.028
So doctors out here specialties and then
we have some doctor videos.

00:18:29.028 --> 00:18:32.080
I mean any kind of media because again,
tourism, medical,

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.868
tourism people need to see actually what
goes on in the specific place.

00:18:35.868 --> 00:18:40.935
So you would need lots of videos and
photos of of to make people confident

00:18:40.935 --> 00:18:41.948
<v Arnab Roy>enough to come.</v>

00:18:42.228 --> 00:18:45.548
And then we have some testimonials and
out here that's pretty much it.

00:18:45.778 --> 00:18:47.118
Come on.
I had a question here for this profile.

00:18:47.118 --> 00:18:47.238
<v Arnab Roy>Booking.</v>

00:18:48.929 --> 00:18:52.851
So in this profile,
let's mention that this doctor is a part

00:18:52.851 --> 00:18:57.930
of health and via text cancer and so is
that's why we have given an option for

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:02.238
video consultation or it's there for all
the doctors profile here.

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:05.128
In treatment dot Hospital also I mean who
are not a part of health.

00:19:05.128 --> 00:19:05.728
<v Arnab Roy>So we have.</v>

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:06.528
<v Arnab Roy>We have that.</v>

00:19:07.228 --> 00:19:09.388
<v Arnab Roy>We have the, so we're keeping it separate.</v>

00:19:09.388 --> 00:19:11.807
I don't how exactly you guys want to
merge this,

00:19:11.807 --> 00:19:12.998
because then it would become very
confusing.

00:19:12.998 --> 00:19:16.438
<v Tanya>Yeah, because, yeah. Then yeah, exactly.</v>

00:19:16.598 --> 00:19:20.758
So either we should not give at all
because there will be doctors who are not

00:19:20.758 --> 00:19:24.758
the part of health unwired and they're
just on this platform only, I mean.

00:19:25.008 --> 00:19:25.728
<v Arnab Roy>So. So that's why.</v>

00:19:25.728 --> 00:19:28.468
That's why this is only for doctors who
are on who, who for.

00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:28.868
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:19:30.187 --> 00:19:32.558
So for this specific example,
I'm I'm showing you a Doctor Who is there

00:19:32.558 --> 00:19:32.918
<v Tanya>Thank you.</v>

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.888
<v Arnab Roy>on Hu.</v>

00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:36.048
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

00:19:36.048 --> 00:19:38.507
Sorry the.
So that's why that that disclaimer is

00:19:38.507 --> 00:19:41.768
there. If it's for a fresh doctor,
he will not get a disclaimer.

00:19:41.768 --> 00:19:45.032
But irrespective of everything,
they will all have the option of a video

00:19:45.032 --> 00:19:47.688
consultation because that is something
which we are giving,

00:19:47.688 --> 00:19:47.714
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:19:47.714 --> 00:19:50.933
most probably a person is gonna
physically come to a country only after

00:19:50.933 --> 00:19:53.168
they have some sort of assurance from the
doctor.

00:19:53.198 --> 00:19:53.398
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

00:19:54.048 --> 00:19:54.888
Ki Aaja may come to my place and we we
know how to, you know,

00:19:54.888 --> 00:19:55.168
<v Tanya>So.</v>

00:19:58.028 --> 00:19:58.590
<v Tanya>Then OK.</v>

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.788
<v Arnab Roy>take care of you guys, huh?</v>

00:19:59.788 --> 00:20:01.148
<v Tanya>Then I have another question.</v>

00:20:01.148 --> 00:20:03.948
Then they the softest,
who are not there on issue.

00:20:08.948 --> 00:20:09.508
<v Arnab Roy>No, no, no.</v>

00:20:09.698 --> 00:20:10.818
<v Tanya>You're connected.</v>
I've kept that separate.

00:20:10.818 --> 00:20:11.218
<v Arnab Roy>I kept that separate.</v>

00:20:11.218 --> 00:20:11.538
<v Tanya>Yeah. OK.</v>

00:20:11.538 --> 00:20:13.258
I don't know Arpanas talking about
merging.

00:20:13.258 --> 00:20:15.388
Arpanas talking key doctors will only go
from Hu, huh?

00:20:15.388 --> 00:20:18.018
No, no. Yeah, obviously we have to merge,
but I just had a question regarding this

00:20:18.018 --> 00:20:19.717
But but I'm keeping that option open
because the initial initial requirement

00:20:19.717 --> 00:20:20.708
<v Tanya>video consultation.</v>

00:20:22.228 --> 00:20:22.268
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:20:22.522 --> 00:20:24.218
<v Arnab Roy>of this project was separate.</v>

00:20:24.218 --> 00:20:25.138
Recap their treatment,
hospital and Hu is gonna be completely

00:20:25.138 --> 00:20:25.698
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:20:27.366 --> 00:20:28.178
<v Arnab Roy>separate, right?</v>

00:20:28.178 --> 00:20:29.078
That was the initial requirement,
but then the merging discussions happened

00:20:29.078 --> 00:20:30.038
<v Tanya>Yeah. Yeah, no.</v>

00:20:32.042 --> 00:20:32.588
<v Arnab Roy>and which is OK but.</v>

00:20:32.588 --> 00:20:34.868
So this is based on the previous
discussion, right?

00:20:35.108 --> 00:20:37.988
Despite the book,
we do consultation this item,

00:20:37.988 --> 00:20:38.564
Hmm, but I feel key for the new No,
no for new one.

00:20:38.564 --> 00:20:40.148
<v Tanya>it shouldn't be there.</v>

00:20:41.108 --> 00:20:46.088
Also should be there because I don't want
to club the consultation part like this.

00:20:46.088 --> 00:20:46.528
Is this this video consultation is
different from what we are doing in Hu?

00:20:46.528 --> 00:20:46.808
<v Tanya>You know.</v>

00:20:52.228 --> 00:20:54.988
It's it's an actual consultation,
so I I I maybe the language language out

00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:55.188
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

00:20:56.466 --> 00:20:57.788
here is wrong.
It would rather be like some it's it's

00:20:57.788 --> 00:20:58.188
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:20:59.517 --> 00:21:00.308
<v Arnab Roy>for this part.</v>

00:21:00.308 --> 00:21:01.748
<v Arnab Roy>This is not exactly a consultation.</v>

00:21:01.748 --> 00:21:02.868
It's more like a clarification that the
patient is taking from the doctor.

00:21:02.868 --> 00:21:02.988
<v Tanya>No.</v>

00:21:04.548 --> 00:21:07.708
It's like a **. ***, he's.
He's asking some questions.

00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:11.908
He's he wants the doctor to justify him
coming to that country and taking the

00:21:11.908 --> 00:21:12.028
<v Tanya>Hmm.</v>

00:21:12.637 --> 00:21:13.268
<v Arnab Roy>treatment.</v>

00:21:13.468 --> 00:21:14.468
<v Arnab Roy>So it is for that.</v>

00:21:14.718 --> 00:21:16.108
Maybe we'll have to change the way we are
putting it to.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:19.775
Because from here,
because from here we are not in Hu Ya has

00:21:19.775 --> 00:21:21.998
a doctor sees everything and then gives a
prescription and all right issues aspects.

00:21:21.998 --> 00:21:22.598
<v Tanya>Play me a song.</v>

00:21:24.885 --> 00:21:24.928
But out here we don't have this issue
prescription thing because out here the

00:21:24.928 --> 00:21:25.128
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:21:29.573 --> 00:21:32.338
deal is making the person come to the
actual.

00:21:32.378 --> 00:21:33.008
<v Arnab Roy>Physical place.</v>

00:21:33.008 --> 00:21:34.138
<v Tanya>No. Yeah, exactly.</v>

00:21:34.138 --> 00:21:35.778
<v Arnab Roy>But yes, there is another thing.</v>

00:21:36.298 --> 00:21:39.178
There is another thing which I which
Arpan has said key.

00:21:40.748 --> 00:21:44.888
Doctors will generally not be on this
plot platform if they are not part of a

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:45.008
<v Tanya>Hmm.</v>

00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:46.428
<v Arnab Roy>institution.</v>

00:21:48.028 --> 00:21:48.268
So treatment dot hospitals main
onboarding rule is you come with your

00:21:48.268 --> 00:21:48.828
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:55.918
medical institution,
whether it's a brand name like Clinicals,

00:21:55.918 --> 00:21:56.078
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:21:56.879 --> 00:22:01.936
Columbia or Fortis or whether it's a
small clinic multi specialty clinic or

00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:03.638
whatever that you have,
you have to come with an organization.

00:22:03.638 --> 00:22:03.838
<v Tanya>Hello.</v>

00:22:06.128 --> 00:22:07.418
<v Arnab Roy>All the doctors that will.</v>

00:22:07.418 --> 00:22:07.858
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:22:07.858 --> 00:22:11.760
Be porting from Hu to th.
Those will be the doctors who are coming

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.709
to th not only to add their profile there,
but to also add the institution's profile

00:22:16.709 --> 00:22:17.058
<v Arnab Roy>there.</v>

00:22:17.058 --> 00:22:18.208
<v Arnab Roy>The institution that they are a part of.</v>

00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:18.528
<v Tanya>No, no.</v>

00:22:20.068 --> 00:22:24.540
Because we want that hospital database to
get created. But this consultation thing,

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.883
yes,
I can understand what you're trying to

00:22:26.883 --> 00:22:26.988
<v Arnab Roy>say also, but.</v>

00:22:26.988 --> 00:22:28.508
<v Tanya>I think we'll have to discuss.</v>

00:22:28.508 --> 00:22:30.158
Yeah,
we'll have to discuss it also next year.

00:22:30.158 --> 00:22:32.298
But there has to be a consultation thing
now whether you want to keep it.

00:22:32.298 --> 00:22:33.338
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

00:22:33.338 --> 00:22:37.419
I mean, we can put it in a different way,
but it shouldn't be like this I think.

00:22:37.419 --> 00:22:41.298
And that would be concluding because
there will be other doctors to how will

00:22:41.298 --> 00:22:42.658
<v Tanya>you give that option there?</v>

00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:44.428
<v Arnab Roy>Hey, Doctor Kathered, it's it's.</v>

00:22:44.428 --> 00:22:45.418
<v Tanya>We can't give it no.</v>

00:22:45.418 --> 00:22:48.938
But isn't that something that he needs to
manage at the back end?

00:22:49.298 --> 00:22:49.738
<v Richa Kapoor >Because who?</v>

00:22:49.738 --> 00:22:53.698
Front end for the party.
Whether they take a consultation from.

00:22:55.268 --> 00:22:58.362
Hospital or we they take from eventually,
though,

00:22:58.362 --> 00:22:58.728
the only thing that we'll have to think
about is because here hospitals will be

00:22:58.728 --> 00:22:58.848
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:23:03.313 --> 00:23:06.188
at play and we are not pushing an
individual doctor,

00:23:06.188 --> 00:23:06.548
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:23:06.592 --> 00:23:08.198
but we are asking them to go through the
hospital.

00:23:08.198 --> 00:23:08.318
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:23:09.908 --> 00:23:11.358
<v Richa Kapoor >So the deal has to be with the hospital.</v>

00:23:11.358 --> 00:23:11.558
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

00:23:11.748 --> 00:23:15.866
It might be wiser to keep it separate
away because you will have a month end

00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:17.898
<v Richa Kapoor >reconciliation with the hospitals now.</v>

00:23:18.938 --> 00:23:24.080
And doctors out here would be more
towards not giving you your exact

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.538
<v Arnab Roy>treatment, prognosis or whatever.</v>

00:23:26.658 --> 00:23:30.502
Because they are trying to bring out here,
when you come on a visit,

00:23:30.502 --> 00:23:35.013
video consultation with a doctor here,
he's basically telling you to come to the

00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:37.018
<v Arnab Roy>location and get physically treated.</v>

00:23:37.538 --> 00:23:40.022
That would what the discussion be about,
but in Hu,

00:23:40.022 --> 00:23:43.509
it's like tell me your condition.
I'm gonna be issuing prescriptions and

00:23:43.509 --> 00:23:43.938
<v Arnab Roy>all that.</v>

00:23:44.788 --> 00:23:46.028
<v Arnab Roy>This video consultation terminology.</v>

00:23:46.028 --> 00:23:49.278
So maybe we'll have to change the
terminology and we wish when it does.

00:23:49.278 --> 00:23:49.948
<v Arnab Roy>Yeah, probably it's not.</v>

00:23:49.948 --> 00:23:50.758
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

00:23:50.758 --> 00:23:54.566
Call it book a video consultation,
or rather wanna talk to someone or

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:56.318
something like that.
Like we'll give the patient some kind of

00:23:56.318 --> 00:23:56.918
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

00:23:57.939 --> 00:23:58.958
option.
But we would out here first priorities

00:23:58.958 --> 00:23:59.158
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

00:24:00.496 --> 00:24:02.998
want the patients to come through a
hospital.

00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:04.548
<v Tanya>No, no, no, exactly.</v>

00:24:04.548 --> 00:24:09.433
So that that is how we would ideally want
them. So from doctors, I'm just,

00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:11.548
I don't thinking key will not take a
payment here or we will take a payment

00:24:11.548 --> 00:24:12.348
<v Tanya>Also yeah.</v>

00:24:14.383 --> 00:24:14.708
<v Arnab Roy>here.</v>

00:24:16.548 --> 00:24:18.048
<v Arnab Roy>I or or we will.</v>

00:24:18.048 --> 00:24:21.608
Only thing this should be a separate
section for payments in a written.

00:24:21.618 --> 00:24:22.858
<v Arnab Roy>Yeah, that payment is different.</v>

00:24:22.858 --> 00:24:24.718
I have two payment sections,
so this is just for the appointment.

00:24:24.718 --> 00:24:26.018
<v Tanya>Thank you. OK.</v>

00:24:26.018 --> 00:24:29.418
Now my question to you guys is whether
this video appointment.

00:24:31.028 --> 00:24:35.072
Yeah, will not go with that because yes,
for the quotation for the actual thing

00:24:35.072 --> 00:24:37.549
and all,
there's another plan that we are doing.

00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:39.773
This is just to get into the payment
thing,

00:24:39.773 --> 00:24:42.148
get the payments cleared for the
consultation.

00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:43.588
<v Arnab Roy>So again, see Tele consultation.</v>

00:24:43.588 --> 00:24:47.248
I think this form you guys have seen it
the same form with just a design change.

00:24:47.248 --> 00:24:47.808
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:24:48.108 --> 00:24:50.468
Teleconfigration consent form for medical
consultations.

00:24:51.208 --> 00:24:55.296
So it has a bunch of disclaimers and all
patient's thing,

00:24:55.296 --> 00:24:57.128
<v Arnab Roy>and then it submits again.</v>

00:24:57.128 --> 00:25:00.008
This is exactly same design,
just with TH components.

00:25:01.548 --> 00:25:07.096
Based on that I get a feedback and some
other things and then I get into my main

00:25:07.096 --> 00:25:11.068
profile, but through hospitals. If I go,
there's another.

00:25:11.118 --> 00:25:16.668
That's why I was just thinking like we
have H2 also to maintain and then we have

00:25:16.668 --> 00:25:17.848
<v Tanya>the pH records also.</v>

00:25:17.848 --> 00:25:18.038
Because if we club those both to,
I think Shankar.

00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:19.278
<v Tanya>So that's what I was asking.</v>

00:25:19.278 --> 00:25:23.158
Yeah,
because we have the consultation part.

00:25:23.668 --> 00:25:23.868
<v Arnab Roy>Shankar.</v>

00:25:25.348 --> 00:25:25.868
<v Shankar S>Yup. Yup.</v>

00:25:26.188 --> 00:25:27.428
<v Arnab Roy>Yeah, you you tell.</v>

00:25:27.428 --> 00:25:31.182
Now, feasibility wise,
keeping things these things separate.

00:25:31.182 --> 00:25:34.998
Are are you OK with,
like clubbing everything into one place?

00:25:34.998 --> 00:25:38.628
Like which would ideally get, you know,
kind of confusing.

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:41.178
<v Shankar S>Of course.</v>

00:25:41.178 --> 00:25:41.228
<v Shankar S>Like it will be quite convenient.</v>

00:25:41.228 --> 00:25:42.068
<v Arnab Roy>Technically.</v>

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:46.548
Technically you can tell us like whether
it's feasible or not.

00:25:48.758 --> 00:25:50.478
Right now, for whatever we are seeing,
right?

00:25:50.478 --> 00:25:54.367
So this these are minor things when it
comes to complex like for example

00:25:54.367 --> 00:25:58.309
maintaining the records of both,
you know doctors with the patient on the

00:25:58.309 --> 00:26:01.238
different platform whether we want to
merge with them.

00:26:01.398 --> 00:26:03.118
<v Shankar S>So that will be quite complex.</v>

00:26:03.118 --> 00:26:07.518
It's yes, it's doable,
but it it is like quite complex.

00:26:08.318 --> 00:26:10.278
<v Shankar S>So that's the case.</v>

00:26:10.278 --> 00:26:11.118
<v Shankar S>For example, let's say.</v>

00:26:11.908 --> 00:26:12.068
<v Shankar S>You know.</v>

00:26:13.628 --> 00:26:18.178
Was also saying whether the doctor has to
be shown to the things,

00:26:18.178 --> 00:26:23.831
so importing that details to here that
direct importing things is not a big deal.

00:26:23.831 --> 00:26:29.188
But when it comes to from here to there,
like from the hospital to issue or the

00:26:29.188 --> 00:26:29.308
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:26:29.346 --> 00:26:31.138
<v Shankar S>vice versa, that would be.</v>

00:26:31.138 --> 00:26:32.018
<v Shankar S>Bit complex, yeah.</v>

00:26:34.038 --> 00:26:35.018
<v Arnab Roy>What is your suggestion keep?</v>

00:26:35.018 --> 00:26:38.584
To drink,
I not feel that now that treatment dot

00:26:38.584 --> 00:26:42.003
hospital,
there's nothing called treatment dot

00:26:42.003 --> 00:26:42.658
<v Tanya>hospital.</v>

00:26:42.658 --> 00:26:42.798
<v Tanya>Now it's an extension of X-ray.</v>

00:26:42.798 --> 00:26:44.898
<v Arnab Roy>It's just another part of extension of Hu.</v>

00:26:44.898 --> 00:26:48.744
So why we have all the like,
you know the color and design everything

00:26:48.744 --> 00:26:53.029
like you showed me a scar thread the
video consultation so so it shouldn't be

00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.578
<v Tanya>different.</v>

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:56.818
It has to be exactly same like we have on
issue, right?

00:26:56.818 --> 00:26:57.478
So it is 4 separate documents.
It will be confusing for us and yeah.

00:26:57.478 --> 00:26:59.198
<v Arnab Roy>No, I mean we are.</v>

00:26:59.198 --> 00:26:59.918
<v Arnab Roy>We are keeping.</v>

00:27:01.968 --> 00:27:05.507
I mean The thing is.
So there was a reasoning behind this like

00:27:05.507 --> 00:27:09.663
we are keeping this flow a little
separate because we want the patient to

00:27:09.663 --> 00:27:10.168
<v Arnab Roy>know, OK.</v>

00:27:10.168 --> 00:27:14.541
He's on the treatment or hospital
platform at that point of time.

00:27:14.541 --> 00:27:16.528
<v Arnab Roy>If he's jumping from Hu to th.</v>

00:27:17.328 --> 00:27:19.118
So we for that significance only,
we're keeping things.

00:27:19.118 --> 00:27:24.137
I think we'll have to discuss this also
with that whether we are keeping this

00:27:24.137 --> 00:27:29.028
name that it's th or just we're we're
gonna call it Hu treatment or something

00:27:29.028 --> 00:27:29.155
<v Arnab Roy>He has already.</v>

00:27:29.155 --> 00:27:29.798
<v Tanya>like that.</v>

00:27:30.188 --> 00:27:34.188
He has already agreed to this logo.
Basically this th logo treatment hospital,

00:27:34.188 --> 00:27:35.948
<v Tanya>OK. OK. Because.</v>

00:27:36.546 --> 00:27:36.948
<v Arnab Roy>it's.</v>

00:27:37.508 --> 00:27:41.250
Then, because the thing with this is,
then it's all separate branding and

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.098
<v Tanya>everything that comes with this.</v>

00:27:42.098 --> 00:27:46.258
I mean it's it's separate branding,
but again it comes like like how practo

00:27:46.258 --> 00:27:49.798
has its proacto normal for users and then
you have like practo corporate rate

00:27:49.798 --> 00:27:50.526
<v Tanya>Thank you. OK.</v>

00:27:50.526 --> 00:27:53.482
corporate method,
it might be a little different in a

00:27:53.482 --> 00:27:54.138
<v Arnab Roy>design wise.</v>

00:27:54.178 --> 00:27:54.768
<v Arnab Roy>Other places also do it.</v>

00:27:54.768 --> 00:27:58.408
So it's it has the name like the name
tactile there also.

00:27:58.408 --> 00:28:00.238
So that's what I was thinking rather than
th it should be like something that has

00:28:00.238 --> 00:28:00.358
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:28:02.936 --> 00:28:03.488
<v Tanya>issue also something like that.</v>

00:28:03.488 --> 00:28:07.856
So because I'm clubbing this entire thing,
keeping exactly Hu design would be

00:28:07.856 --> 00:28:10.018
confusing for the user because they would
not know.

00:28:10.018 --> 00:28:11.658
<v Tanya>No, no design, I said. Fine.</v>

00:28:11.658 --> 00:28:13.738
<v Tanya>Just a logo thing and all.</v>

00:28:13.738 --> 00:28:14.248
<v Tanya>I mean that that that for me. No, no.</v>

00:28:14.248 --> 00:28:17.095
The logo thing also not like he won't
know.

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:20.394
He's so a patient might get confused.
'cause he's.

00:28:20.394 --> 00:28:23.288
He went there to search for just a
consultation which Hu provides.

00:28:23.288 --> 00:28:23.528
<v Tanya>Please.</v>

00:28:25.008 --> 00:28:29.575
But then somehow he lands up on the
hospital section and like patients,

00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:34.650
users normally make a lot of navigational
mistakes when they go through the the

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:35.728
<v Arnab Roy>websites and all.</v>

00:28:35.728 --> 00:28:37.848
<v Arnab Roy>So they he might not notice.</v>

00:28:38.788 --> 00:28:41.428
<v Arnab Roy>He's on a different portal right now.</v>

00:28:41.428 --> 00:28:46.028
Or it's it's the assisting portal,
not the main thing that he wanted to know.

00:28:46.028 --> 00:28:49.748
Do so he might not recognize everything
remains the same.

00:28:50.158 --> 00:28:50.438
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:28:50.968 --> 00:28:53.648
That's why I've kept things a little
separate.

00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:54.608
<v Arnab Roy>But it's OK, right?</v>

00:28:54.608 --> 00:28:58.308
Like,
as long as we have the ability to send

00:28:58.308 --> 00:29:04.638
them from Hu to th and then vice versa,
we can keep certain things separate,

00:29:04.638 --> 00:29:06.348
<v Arnab Roy>right, the design wise.</v>

00:29:06.348 --> 00:29:08.068
And it also has a separate login right?
So.

00:29:08.068 --> 00:29:12.298
Because now logins again,
Shankar should let me know like user side

00:29:12.298 --> 00:29:12.594
No,
I mean ideally should not have a separate

00:29:12.594 --> 00:29:14.258
<v Arnab Roy>say what are we deciding?</v>

00:29:15.518 --> 00:29:15.828
<v Tanya>login.</v>

00:29:15.828 --> 00:29:22.068
I have created it but I want Shankar's
input into this also like. What are his.

00:29:22.068 --> 00:29:23.428
<v Arnab Roy>What would you say Shankar like?</v>

00:29:24.478 --> 00:29:25.348
Like just to confirm here,
will there be a same patient if there is

00:29:25.348 --> 00:29:25.468
<v Arnab Roy>Hey.</v>

00:29:28.105 --> 00:29:29.988
a new patient than that we need to log in
for this?

00:29:29.988 --> 00:29:31.878
A new patient or a new patient.
But then as Arpan said, new patients,

00:29:31.878 --> 00:29:32.878
<v Shankar S>Yes, it is required.</v>

00:29:34.719 --> 00:29:37.828
they're never going to land into th
directly.

00:29:39.148 --> 00:29:39.498
<v Shankar S>OK.</v>

00:29:39.498 --> 00:29:39.898
<v Arnab Roy>They are.</v>

00:29:39.898 --> 00:29:43.418
<v Arnab Roy>They will go to THY Hu only.</v>

00:29:44.988 --> 00:29:45.388
<v Arnab Roy>Hu OK.</v>

00:29:45.388 --> 00:29:52.418
I'll show you one second in this merged
design map. So see, this is how Hu is now.

00:29:53.608 --> 00:29:53.698
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:29:53.698 --> 00:29:59.024
So probably out here somewhere we can
have the so out here in the redesigned Hu.

00:29:59.024 --> 00:30:04.152
Man, I've added one section for th.
So maybe you can add a button on the main

00:30:04.152 --> 00:30:06.058
<v Arnab Roy>navigational so I don't know.</v>

00:30:11.238 --> 00:30:11.558
<v Shankar S>OK.</v>

00:30:11.628 --> 00:30:17.511
So from out here probably we can send you
know them, OK, the alignment either. OK.

00:30:17.511 --> 00:30:21.551
OK. Out here.
We basically have a section for treatment.

00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:22.188
<v Arnab Roy>Hospital.</v>

00:30:22.468 --> 00:30:26.019
So presenting treatment,
hospital looking for affordable onsite

00:30:26.019 --> 00:30:28.904
medical care. Let us handle it for you.
This, this,

00:30:28.904 --> 00:30:32.588
this and then explore more may probably
send them to the th part and if they

00:30:32.588 --> 00:30:33.175
So just just to confirm here that see for
example if I'm a new patient and I wanted

00:30:33.175 --> 00:30:33.508
<v Arnab Roy>login.</v>

00:30:38.816 --> 00:30:42.301
to have a things.
So if I come to th platform,

00:30:42.301 --> 00:30:48.232
so then whether I need to create return
user account on the th or via treatment

00:30:48.232 --> 00:30:49.178
<v Shankar S>hospital sign up there same.</v>

00:30:49.178 --> 00:30:50.308
If I'm I what I'm thinking is if if I'm
already a registered member of Hu,

00:30:50.308 --> 00:30:51.388
<v Shankar S>Details will be approving.</v>

00:30:54.312 --> 00:30:55.038
then th may I can directly go with those
same credentials with the same

00:30:55.038 --> 00:30:55.158
<v Shankar S>Hmm.</v>

00:30:58.508 --> 00:30:59.240
<v Shankar S>Yes, with the same credentials.</v>

00:30:59.240 --> 00:30:59.908
credentials I have to register my cell
phone.

00:30:59.908 --> 00:31:02.853
Yeah,
but there also do I need do we need to

00:31:02.853 --> 00:31:07.891
show the your login or directly from
whenever the user is log in clicking on

00:31:07.891 --> 00:31:08.908
<v Shankar S>log in to the hedge it redirects to the.</v>

00:31:08.908 --> 00:31:14.783
No. For user let him jump.
Let him jump directly into the TH profile.

00:31:14.783 --> 00:31:17.468
<v Arnab Roy>I mean th his th, you know view.</v>

00:31:20.068 --> 00:31:20.498
<v Shankar S>OK.</v>

00:31:20.498 --> 00:31:20.658
<v Tanya>Can't be like legs, listen.</v>

00:31:20.658 --> 00:31:21.028
'Cause like we don't want the users to
again and again like log in right?

00:31:21.028 --> 00:31:22.548
<v Shankar S>See, I'm just having this question.</v>

00:31:26.078 --> 00:31:26.278
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm.</v>

00:31:26.638 --> 00:31:27.388
If he's logged in,
if he's if in the back end, we know, OK,

00:31:27.388 --> 00:31:27.708
<v Tanya>You know.</v>

00:31:31.687 --> 00:31:36.652
he online on Hu,
we give him a button like beside join our

00:31:36.652 --> 00:31:38.158
community or somewhere where he can jump
into the th dashboard th portal.

00:31:38.158 --> 00:31:38.358
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm.</v>

00:31:43.958 --> 00:31:44.378
<v Arnab Roy>And then he does whatever he wants.</v>

00:31:44.378 --> 00:31:44.538
<v Shankar S>OK.</v>

00:31:44.538 --> 00:31:45.938
<v Shankar S>I have two questions here.</v>

00:31:46.178 --> 00:31:47.138
<v Shankar S>Yeah, got it.</v>

00:31:47.138 --> 00:31:48.658
<v Shankar S>So so I have two questions here.</v>

00:31:48.658 --> 00:31:51.298
So for example, if I'm an existing user,
so.

00:31:52.108 --> 00:31:53.228
<v Arnab Roy>Existing Hu user.</v>

00:31:53.238 --> 00:31:56.318
We can use the same login when they click
on Hu.

00:31:56.318 --> 00:31:59.953
We can use the same credential if you are
a member of the.

00:31:59.953 --> 00:32:02.518
We can log into th if you are a member of
Hu, that is fine. If I'm a new user,

00:32:02.518 --> 00:32:04.108
<v Arnab Roy>Uh ah.</v>

00:32:04.821 --> 00:32:08.318
let's say I'm a new user.
I'm a new patient and clicking on to the

00:32:08.318 --> 00:32:08.398
<v Arnab Roy>Oh.</v>

00:32:08.949 --> 00:32:09.318
<v Shankar S>TH to.</v>

00:32:09.318 --> 00:32:11.138
Wanted to know more information or create
an account in th whether I need to

00:32:11.138 --> 00:32:11.618
<v Arnab Roy>Ha ha.</v>

00:32:13.613 --> 00:32:17.964
redirect to Hu to create an account.
If that is not the case then we can have

00:32:17.964 --> 00:32:18.418
<v Shankar S>it on login, there's no problem.</v>

00:32:18.418 --> 00:32:18.658
<v Arnab Roy>OK.</v>

00:32:18.658 --> 00:32:20.618
<v Arnab Roy>I'm kind of blanking in this area.</v>

00:32:20.618 --> 00:32:22.538
I think I need some help from you guys on
this.

00:32:23.008 --> 00:32:23.388
<v Tanya>OK, Arnab, I think.</v>

00:32:23.388 --> 00:32:24.548
<v Arnab Roy>How how are you guys?</v>

00:32:26.118 --> 00:32:26.848
How are you guys planning to handle this
login part of of users Doctor?

00:32:26.848 --> 00:32:27.488
<v Tanya>Oh.</v>

00:32:30.498 --> 00:32:30.618
<v Tanya>1.</v>

00:32:30.708 --> 00:32:33.638
I think I know I have created that flow
for users.

00:32:33.638 --> 00:32:33.798
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:32:34.198 --> 00:32:36.958
<v Arnab Roy>Are you gonna send them via Hu to th?</v>

00:32:36.958 --> 00:32:37.748
<v Arnab Roy>Keep it, keep it exclusively.</v>

00:32:37.748 --> 00:32:42.068
And I believe should be wirection because
because treatment on hospitals is nothing

00:32:42.068 --> 00:32:43.388
<v Arnab Roy>Now I'm saying the logins.</v>

00:32:44.369 --> 00:32:50.674
but yeah log in log in has to be just one
means if anybody want to use that you

00:32:50.674 --> 00:32:51.068
<v Tanya>know.</v>

00:32:52.638 --> 00:32:57.063
A feature or like that service that they
want to go directly for the treatment,

00:32:57.063 --> 00:32:59.718
but they will land on that page like
treatment.

00:33:00.198 --> 00:33:02.476
Again,
they have to log in on Hu only because

00:33:02.476 --> 00:33:04.358
<v Tanya>it's more like a feature of Hu, right?</v>

00:33:04.358 --> 00:33:10.508
So they need to know that Hu is the brand
and this is the service provided by H.

00:33:10.508 --> 00:33:12.388
<v Tanya>One H is the main thing.</v>

00:33:12.388 --> 00:33:15.994
So they can go and check our video
consultation, you know,

00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:18.768
services also like whatever we are
providing so.

00:33:18.768 --> 00:33:21.802
Hannah,
let's just think about it a little bit,

00:33:21.802 --> 00:33:22.708
Tanya.
Let's just think about it a little bit

00:33:22.708 --> 00:33:23.548
<v Tanya>Sure. Yeah.</v>

00:33:24.709 --> 00:33:28.248
because this person is what you're saying.
Makes sense.

00:33:28.448 --> 00:33:36.448
But consider that that at that place he's
not going to go there for treatment at Hu.

00:33:37.128 --> 00:33:40.688
They're basically trying to take an
opinion from an international Dr. here,

00:33:40.688 --> 00:33:41.128
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:33:42.137 --> 00:33:44.048
<v Richa Kapoor >considering to come to India.</v>

00:33:45.138 --> 00:33:45.258
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:33:45.878 --> 00:33:49.369
For us,
so ideally it does make sense to have

00:33:49.369 --> 00:33:51.288
login via SU,
but I it does not make sense to go and

00:33:51.288 --> 00:33:51.568
<v Tanya>No.</v>

00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:59.234
dilute the message there because there
only they actually there only getting

00:33:59.234 --> 00:34:03.407
video consultation.
Here it is much more than it is at

00:34:03.407 --> 00:34:05.228
<v Richa Kapoor >hospital level. Why you.</v>

00:34:05.228 --> 00:34:05.518
<v Richa Kapoor >Can have a.</v>

00:34:05.518 --> 00:34:06.998
<v Tanya>Yeah, I agree, Rachel.</v>

00:34:07.158 --> 00:34:08.118
<v Tanya>That's what I said.</v>

00:34:08.118 --> 00:34:12.786
I just said that the login should be
saved and this can be like separate thing,

00:34:12.786 --> 00:34:12.868
<v Tanya>but the login should be same.</v>

00:34:12.868 --> 00:34:13.628
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah, but what?</v>

00:34:13.748 --> 00:34:14.828
<v Richa Kapoor >How does it matter?</v>

00:34:14.828 --> 00:34:16.428
<v Richa Kapoor >And Shankar, this is a question for you.</v>

00:34:16.428 --> 00:34:20.910
Not for Tanya,
but maybe what looks outward is a is a

00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:26.719
form where people are actually
registering on treatment dot hospital,

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:33.108
but at the back end the form is being
fetched at Hu only the parent company.

00:34:33.828 --> 00:34:37.748
So I'll basically what I'm trying to say
is take example of Zomato.

00:34:38.558 --> 00:34:44.148
So you have a separate you log into
Zomato and then you get.

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:46.148
<v Richa Kapoor >You basically are logged on to district.</v>

00:34:46.148 --> 00:34:49.166
Also,
you are logged onto their other websites

00:34:49.166 --> 00:34:52.184
also,
so eventually every data is going to the

00:34:52.184 --> 00:34:53.468
<v Richa Kapoor >parent company only.</v>

00:34:53.508 --> 00:34:53.988
So if we have a formula which is taking
the information but actually getting

00:34:53.988 --> 00:34:54.308
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>

00:34:57.778 --> 00:35:00.828
merged into the master database,
how does that matter?

00:35:01.788 --> 00:35:02.788
<v Shankar S>See that thing we can do?</v>

00:35:02.788 --> 00:35:06.194
See how what uh,
Zomato and District does is like before

00:35:06.194 --> 00:35:09.302
logging in.
When they click on when they submit the

00:35:09.302 --> 00:35:14.022
what is a number or an e-mail in the back
and what happens is like we we gonna

00:35:14.022 --> 00:35:17.428
search whether the existing customer is
there in Zomato.

00:35:18.638 --> 00:35:21.798
So with that validation of the number,
they gonna search it.

00:35:21.798 --> 00:35:25.598
Oh, there is a user in Zomato,
so we wanted to import the details.

00:35:25.598 --> 00:35:28.078
<v Shankar S>That's what the procedure goes, OK?</v>

00:35:28.078 --> 00:35:30.998
The log in process will be from the
district itself.

00:35:31.158 --> 00:35:31.758
<v Shankar S>Why log in?</v>

00:35:31.758 --> 00:35:36.160
He gonna enter with number and we're
gonna search in the database whether the

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.336
user is there in the Zomato or not.
Once the user is found in the Zomato,

00:35:40.336 --> 00:35:42.198
<v Shankar S>he gonna import the same details.</v>

00:35:42.998 --> 00:35:45.118
In this thing,
so that process we can do it.

00:35:45.988 --> 00:35:46.458
That process we can do it if you follow
the same log in.

00:35:46.458 --> 00:35:51.586
And then let's say that if you if by the
number the he's not able to fetch through

00:35:51.586 --> 00:35:54.860
the matter,
then we ask him to create a new profile.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.258
But that profile can be created on
treatment also, no.

00:35:59.168 --> 00:36:00.728
<v Shankar S>Yeah, the both lies to the master.</v>

00:36:00.728 --> 00:36:01.968
You know database itself that we can do
it, yeah.

00:36:01.968 --> 00:36:04.318
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah. So that's what I'm thinking.</v>

00:36:04.318 --> 00:36:06.798
So in that scenario we need separate
logins then right?

00:36:06.878 --> 00:36:07.028
<v Shankar S>Yes, yes, yes, that.</v>

00:36:07.028 --> 00:36:10.118
Yeah, even if it is looking different,
but eventually at the back end everything

00:36:10.118 --> 00:36:10.158
<v Shankar S>Is.</v>

00:36:11.272 --> 00:36:12.948
<v Richa Kapoor >is getting merged together only.</v>

00:36:14.158 --> 00:36:14.438
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>

00:36:15.278 --> 00:36:18.114
For doctors,
I the confusion was for patients,

00:36:18.114 --> 00:36:18.838
<v Arnab Roy>for doctors.</v>

00:36:18.838 --> 00:36:21.792
Jessica,
there is a Hu unique member code they can

00:36:21.792 --> 00:36:25.588
add right from which it fetches and
basically things get synced, sort of.

00:36:25.588 --> 00:36:30.163
But we are also again there are majorly
independent doctors are much lesser.

00:36:30.163 --> 00:36:35.153
We are doing it at the hospital level and
then the hospital creates profiles of its

00:36:35.153 --> 00:36:35.628
<v Richa Kapoor >doctors.</v>

00:36:40.388 --> 00:36:40.608
Yes. I mean, yeah, the hospital on boards,
doctors.

00:36:40.608 --> 00:36:41.168
<v Richa Kapoor >Play me a song.</v>

00:36:43.958 --> 00:36:44.278
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:36:44.638 --> 00:36:45.798
<v Arnab Roy>But we will.</v>

00:36:45.798 --> 00:36:48.629
The Doctor will still have his own,
you know, dashboard,

00:36:48.629 --> 00:36:50.118
<v Arnab Roy>like how he does in Hu, right?</v>

00:36:50.118 --> 00:36:51.048
<v Arnab Roy>Like where he can add new stuff.</v>

00:36:51.048 --> 00:36:54.328
Tell me the owner who was there,
but can you're there?

00:36:54.328 --> 00:36:57.728
The doctor is coordinating directly with
us here.

00:36:57.728 --> 00:36:59.248
<v Richa Kapoor >The hospital will coordinate.</v>

00:36:59.328 --> 00:36:59.548
He will create the profile of the people
and probably the hospitals will manage

00:36:59.548 --> 00:36:59.668
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:37:03.963 --> 00:37:06.048
<v Richa Kapoor >their profiles also not the doctors.</v>

00:37:07.598 --> 00:37:09.871
No,
but doctors will have their dashboards as

00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:10.118
<v Arnab Roy>well.</v>

00:37:10.158 --> 00:37:10.798
Hospitals will, of course,
have see in this case this is a doctor

00:37:10.798 --> 00:37:10.998
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.998
dashboard for treatment dot hospital for
th.

00:37:18.678 --> 00:37:24.548
So it shows his linked hospital and gives
some overviews but like not much actions

00:37:24.548 --> 00:37:26.368
<v Arnab Roy>but he can see some upcoming appointments.</v>

00:37:26.368 --> 00:37:26.608
<v Richa Kapoor >Hello.</v>

00:37:27.518 --> 00:37:32.527
Scheduled login is those same things
which are there in Hu with minor changes

00:37:32.527 --> 00:37:37.278
and he can jump onto to his Hu dashboard
and th dashboard and vice versa.

00:37:38.438 --> 00:37:41.531
From there,
this is how the doctor's flow starts,

00:37:41.531 --> 00:37:42.728
basically. But for patients,
I haven't really given that.

00:37:42.728 --> 00:37:42.888
<v Richa Kapoor >Yeah.</v>

00:37:45.438 --> 00:37:46.008
But Shankar, like patient,
can we do something?

00:37:46.008 --> 00:37:48.888
<v Richa Kapoor >Let's also think about it a little bit.</v>

00:37:49.318 --> 00:37:51.188
I've I in the initial stage of the
Shankar you guys had given patients also

00:37:51.188 --> 00:37:51.868
<v Tanya>Yeah, sure.</v>

00:37:54.716 --> 00:37:56.988
<v Arnab Roy>have unique member codes, right?</v>

00:37:58.108 --> 00:37:59.258
Now patient doesn't have a unique member
code, only only the doctor.

00:37:59.258 --> 00:38:00.208
No, patient doesn't have no.
Then in that case,

00:38:00.208 --> 00:38:02.648
<v Arnab Roy>Oh, OK. Pier.</v>

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.118
<v Tanya>if we this case will might need that now.</v>

00:38:05.118 --> 00:38:08.303
A cha cha. No.
I thought that for a quick sign up.

00:38:08.303 --> 00:38:12.208
Like he's already a part of ahu like he
just wants to go to th and have a profile

00:38:12.208 --> 00:38:12.528
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:38:13.423 --> 00:38:18.293
again, telling him to fill up all his,
give his photo, give his name, number,

00:38:18.293 --> 00:38:20.228
<v Arnab Roy>address and everything instead.</v>

00:38:20.228 --> 00:38:23.468
Of doing that,
if he gives his unique number or patient

00:38:23.468 --> 00:38:23.668
<v Tanya>Hello.</v>

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.748
code,
I don't it automatically fetches and.

00:38:26.788 --> 00:38:27.048
We can do is like whenever the he's no,
no,

00:38:27.048 --> 00:38:29.438
Who is it keeping it separate than me
that?

00:38:29.438 --> 00:38:34.254
the weekend something due like this is
like whenever we found the e-mail ID and

00:38:34.254 --> 00:38:38.228
he's logging right so we give a pop up
whether he's there in the.

00:38:39.958 --> 00:38:40.038
<v Shankar S>Hu.</v>

00:38:40.038 --> 00:38:43.425
So if that is the case,
he gonna click on check box or something

00:38:43.425 --> 00:38:45.738
like that then all the details it gonna
fetch it and.

00:38:45.738 --> 00:38:48.198
No, no. If he if he's there in Hu,
it will never happen because patients are

00:38:48.198 --> 00:38:48.438
<v Shankar S>Should.</v>

00:38:49.465 --> 00:38:51.498
<v Arnab Roy>never going to directly get into th right.</v>

00:38:51.698 --> 00:38:51.938
They're only going to go via Hu, no.
So once he's there in Hu.

00:38:51.938 --> 00:38:52.058
<v Shankar S>Hmm.</v>

00:38:55.698 --> 00:38:59.698
But The thing is, there are two.
There are two scenarios here.

00:38:59.698 --> 00:39:00.978
<v Arnab Roy>One is he's in Hu.</v>

00:39:01.758 --> 00:39:01.878
<v Shankar S>Hmm.</v>

00:39:02.518 --> 00:39:05.798
And he's a registered member of Hu.
Like he's he's someone who has a profile.

00:39:05.798 --> 00:39:07.838
<v Arnab Roy>Another is he goes into Hu.</v>

00:39:07.958 --> 00:39:10.948
He has not created any Hu profile,
but out there he's more interested in th.

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:11.268
<v Shankar S>OK.</v>

00:39:15.158 --> 00:39:15.178
So then then he has to create a fresh
profile.

00:39:15.178 --> 00:39:18.718
Then he has to uploaded things in the
fresh profile.

00:39:18.718 --> 00:39:22.038
<v Arnab Roy>Like fresh fresh registration in th.</v>

00:39:22.878 --> 00:39:23.038
So we are giving the options.
I know the the main priority is getting

00:39:23.038 --> 00:39:23.278
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>

00:39:27.268 --> 00:39:30.529
patients from Hu to th and all registered
patients,

00:39:30.529 --> 00:39:35.608
but there might also be patients who are
who have gone into the Hu landing page,

00:39:35.608 --> 00:39:39.558
checked everything and they are not
interested in what Hu has.

00:39:39.558 --> 00:39:41.385
To offer,
but they're certainly interested in what

00:39:41.385 --> 00:39:41.958
<v Arnab Roy>th has to offer.</v>

00:39:42.678 --> 00:39:45.964
So they're like I'm I don't create a
profile for, you know,

00:39:45.964 --> 00:39:50.290
Hui want to explore through th get into
their portal and have a profile there.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:54.343
So because this might also be the
scenario unless you're telling from the

00:39:54.343 --> 00:39:57.628
company itself they they give a
disclaimer that you cannot.

00:39:57.708 --> 00:40:00.588
Avail th services if you are not a member
of Hu.

00:40:01.618 --> 00:40:01.938
<v Shankar S>Yeah, I thought.</v>

00:40:01.938 --> 00:40:02.218
But but, but that is not.
But I think Richard Dane,

00:40:02.218 --> 00:40:04.258
<v Shankar S>We need to give that node to them.</v>

00:40:04.636 --> 00:40:07.588
you guys should tell us like that doesn't
sound like a good thing for patients,

00:40:07.588 --> 00:40:08.787
<v Tanya>No, no, I don't think that is not right.</v>

00:40:08.787 --> 00:40:09.098
<v Arnab Roy>right?</v>

00:40:09.418 --> 00:40:10.348
<v Arnab Roy>Yeah, that's not right.</v>

00:40:10.348 --> 00:40:11.138
I mean, if they don't, don't want it to,
then they shouldn't.

00:40:11.138 --> 00:40:12.178
<v Arnab Roy>Like we are not, we can't.</v>

00:40:15.808 --> 00:40:18.168
<v Arnab Roy>So we have to keep the options open.</v>

00:40:18.238 --> 00:40:19.038
Ideal in a ideal scenario, yes,
a patient comes.

00:40:19.038 --> 00:40:19.358
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:40:21.838 --> 00:40:22.878
<v Arnab Roy>He's an Hu member.</v>

00:40:23.158 --> 00:40:26.488
He jumps into th gives his.
I don't know some member code or some

00:40:26.488 --> 00:40:30.624
some kind of recognizing factor like his
mobile number and automatically you know

00:40:30.624 --> 00:40:34.558
he supported but there might be other
people who don't want to go through Hu.

00:40:35.038 --> 00:40:37.438
They're like I'm only I'm only concerned
about th.

00:40:38.848 --> 00:40:43.259
And it the point comes here is like there.
There is no point of merging it, right,

00:40:43.259 --> 00:40:44.988
but not into like maybe in the back end
it's merging.

00:40:44.988 --> 00:40:47.268
<v Arnab Roy>See the merge copy out there.</v>

00:40:47.268 --> 00:40:47.688
Are there are very few places where the
merge thing actually shows for example.

00:40:47.688 --> 00:40:49.128
<v Shankar S>But to the user, it'll be only one.</v>

00:40:53.288 --> 00:40:57.118
This is the profile page of Hu doctor Nah.
Right out here, there is a section.

00:40:57.118 --> 00:40:57.238
<v Shankar S>Hmm.</v>

00:40:59.818 --> 00:41:01.188
Can you see below the consultation slot
treatment hospital? Me.

00:41:01.188 --> 00:41:01.388
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm.</v>

00:41:03.956 --> 00:41:05.378
<v Arnab Roy>He's an active member.</v>

00:41:06.928 --> 00:41:07.608
<v Arnab Roy>He's doctor Sandeep.</v>

00:41:07.608 --> 00:41:10.658
Nayak is also a registered member of
Medicare Hospital,

00:41:10.658 --> 00:41:11.638
<v Arnab Roy>which is situated in India.</v>

00:41:11.638 --> 00:41:11.758
<v Shankar S>Hmm.</v>

00:41:12.288 --> 00:41:17.070
This is the basically the inquire now so
and then in Hua Dr.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.833
list here in there also there might be th
tags.

00:41:20.833 --> 00:41:27.183
So we are kind of giving the patients a
sort of glimpse OK this this doctor that

00:41:27.183 --> 00:41:31.808
you're seeing out here he's also a
treatment hospital Reg.

00:41:31.808 --> 00:41:33.848
<v Arnab Roy>Member and from everywhere we can.</v>

00:41:34.128 --> 00:41:38.262
So if I I don't know now you guys can
tell that like if I suppose here or

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:40.998
something it takes him to the th doctor
profile.

00:41:43.038 --> 00:41:46.118
From where he can, you know,
jump into his treatment.

00:41:46.388 --> 00:41:49.957
From the 18 oh,
where there certain teach registered

00:41:49.957 --> 00:41:50.428
<v Tanya>member.</v>

00:41:50.958 --> 00:41:51.238
<v Tanya>On.</v>

00:41:51.578 --> 00:41:56.788
So this is this is actually the doctor
profile page of Hu Health unwired.

00:41:56.788 --> 00:41:58.528
<v Tanya>Mm hmm. Yeah, no, I got it.</v>

00:41:58.528 --> 00:41:59.048
<v Arnab Roy>But because.</v>

00:41:59.158 --> 00:42:02.173
So you're saying how when he go on to
that,

00:42:02.173 --> 00:42:04.268
like from this page registered Member tab
like making one that?

00:42:04.268 --> 00:42:07.414
So I was just thinking like registered
member.

00:42:07.414 --> 00:42:10.068
This becomes a yeah clickable thing where
all the all the doctor profiles that have

00:42:10.068 --> 00:42:11.588
<v Tanya>Yeah, that's what I'm asking. OK.</v>

00:42:13.037 --> 00:42:14.308
<v Arnab Roy>A tag of TH member.</v>

00:42:14.748 --> 00:42:15.478
Yeah. So if I click,
it directly takes him to his pH doctor

00:42:15.478 --> 00:42:15.678
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

00:42:19.584 --> 00:42:19.588
<v Arnab Roy>profile.</v>

00:42:19.588 --> 00:42:19.988
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:42:23.278 --> 00:42:26.918
And then I think the consultation wise
you guys raised a correct point.

00:42:26.918 --> 00:42:30.278
I mean the confusion of the so the naming
has to be different.

00:42:30.278 --> 00:42:31.038
<v Arnab Roy>We can't call it.</v>

00:42:31.038 --> 00:42:31.298
Call it the exact same thing as booking a
consultation for Hu. For this,

00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:31.698
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:42:36.258 --> 00:42:36.458
<v Tanya>Yes.</v>

00:42:36.565 --> 00:42:39.518
<v Arnab Roy>we have to call it some. I'll I'll see.</v>

00:42:39.518 --> 00:42:41.358
<v Arnab Roy>Like some different name probably.</v>

00:42:41.758 --> 00:42:46.078
Inquire probably get an inquiry or
inquire now or something like that.

00:42:49.188 --> 00:42:49.548
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:42:50.188 --> 00:42:51.118
So this is where the merged elements a
plate.

00:42:51.118 --> 00:42:52.878
<v Tanya>And also under the sword.</v>

00:42:54.648 --> 00:42:55.078
Yeah. Question. So before this,
we were discussing like which I was

00:42:55.078 --> 00:42:55.558
<v Arnab Roy>Yeah. OK.</v>

00:42:58.598 --> 00:43:01.908
mentioning right,
like the estimated amount like for the

00:43:01.908 --> 00:43:04.928
treatment that we need to show for all
the doctors.

00:43:05.048 --> 00:43:08.418
So are we showing like categories for for
this particular treatment?

00:43:08.418 --> 00:43:09.098
<v Arnab Roy>Category wise no.</v>

00:43:09.098 --> 00:43:10.618
<v Arnab Roy>That's what. That's what Richa said.</v>

00:43:10.618 --> 00:43:11.558
Now,
like if there are specific specialties.

00:43:11.558 --> 00:43:13.118
<v Tanya>I mean that is fine, Anna.</v>

00:43:13.118 --> 00:43:16.885
But don't do thing like,
it's an important thing and it should be

00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:20.678
like shown on like on the top of the
profile showing this the ratings and

00:43:20.678 --> 00:43:21.109
<v Arnab Roy>The thing is, how are you gonna pinpoint?</v>

00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:22.478
<v Tanya>everything. What's this?</v>

00:43:22.998 --> 00:43:25.838
<v Arnab Roy>See, when it comes, doctors are settled.</v>

00:43:26.358 --> 00:43:29.091
I mean,
there are doctors who specialize in only

00:43:29.091 --> 00:43:33.163
one thing, like all the data,
every single treatment that a doctor does.

00:43:33.163 --> 00:43:34.698
If you put it on a list and then along
with their price range it,

00:43:34.698 --> 00:43:34.898
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:43:36.844 --> 00:43:38.238
<v Arnab Roy>it becomes kind of gingy.</v>

00:43:38.238 --> 00:43:41.118
Now already there's a lot of information
going on out here.

00:43:41.408 --> 00:43:41.608
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

00:43:42.848 --> 00:43:47.644
Like or or we can do something OK which
is which I don't like. Technically,

00:43:47.644 --> 00:43:52.188
whether it's feasible or not,
where if our patient is searching through

00:43:52.188 --> 00:43:57.173
a specific like he he cares about kidney
related, his issues are with kidneys.

00:43:57.173 --> 00:44:00.328
So if he's searching through kidneys and
all and.

00:44:00.328 --> 00:44:03.793
When he gets into a certain profile or a
page or whatever,

00:44:03.793 --> 00:44:06.728
because he asserts with kidney,
we like give him.

00:44:07.768 --> 00:44:13.077
A tag or something or banner where it it
kind of a popup or something which shows

00:44:13.077 --> 00:44:17.997
key treatment at this place is cheaper
compared to treatment at us for this

00:44:17.997 --> 00:44:21.752
kidneyrelated ailments because this is
how the US ranges.

00:44:21.752 --> 00:44:25.248
This is how the Indian Ranges or
something like that.

00:44:26.028 --> 00:44:27.268
<v Arnab Roy>So in that case, what happens?</v>

00:44:27.268 --> 00:44:31.953
The information only shows if the person
is searching through a specific thing,

00:44:31.953 --> 00:44:34.588
because how will we anticipate exactly
what?

00:44:35.188 --> 00:44:35.838
Or we have to give this statistic or
because or else the alternative is we

00:44:35.838 --> 00:44:37.118
<v Tanya>I think this is a good idea.</v>

00:44:37.118 --> 00:44:37.838
<v Tanya>We can do this.</v>

00:44:38.538 --> 00:44:39.630
<v Tanya>This this can be done.</v>

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:44.131
have to give this statistic for each and
every specialty and each and every

00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:45.908
treatment which becomes kind of, you know,
impossible.

00:44:45.908 --> 00:44:46.188
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:44:48.928 --> 00:44:52.581
I mean it's possible,
but that's like a giant data dump because

00:44:52.581 --> 00:44:55.833
from my examples you're seeing like what,
6 specialties.

00:44:55.833 --> 00:44:57.488
<v Arnab Roy>Some doctors might have more.</v>

00:44:57.748 --> 00:44:58.028
<v Tanya>Well.</v>

00:44:59.128 --> 00:45:02.788
Some doctors might have less and and can
really anticipate in this situation, so.

00:45:02.788 --> 00:45:05.178
I mean,
we don't really have to mention the

00:45:05.178 --> 00:45:05.324
<v Richa Kapoor >Open phone book.</v>

00:45:05.324 --> 00:45:09.473
comparison price and balance,
but the price that the doctor is offering

00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:10.048
that we can show,
I mean if that patient is particularly

00:45:10.048 --> 00:45:11.008
<v Arnab Roy>So if he.</v>

00:45:12.757 --> 00:45:14.328
<v Tanya>searching for that treatment.</v>

00:45:14.328 --> 00:45:17.888
As a patient, as a patient,
I jump into a doctor's profile.

00:45:17.888 --> 00:45:21.394
I I see this doctor is good at this
specific treatment and because I've

00:45:21.394 --> 00:45:22.278
searched with that treatment,
that keyword or something,

00:45:22.278 --> 00:45:22.478
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:26.838
I get a pop up or a for temporary banner
which comes on top saying key because you

00:45:26.838 --> 00:45:27.118
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:45:28.212 --> 00:45:31.328
search for this doctor this doctor's
treatment is cheaper than.

00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:35.488
What you would have got in us or UK or
whatever first world country example.

00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:38.728
<v Arnab Roy>So only based on that we can give.</v>

00:45:40.648 --> 00:45:41.698
So he gets the so the end end result is
what end result is patient coming to know

00:45:41.698 --> 00:45:42.098
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:45:45.171 --> 00:45:49.694
that yes the the option that I am picking
is is much more affordable than what it

00:45:49.694 --> 00:45:51.128
<v Arnab Roy>is normally in my country.</v>

00:45:54.368 --> 00:45:56.208
<v Arnab Roy>So we can do something like that.</v>

00:45:58.078 --> 00:45:58.318
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:45:59.118 --> 00:45:59.408
So not sure about the comparison thing
though.

00:45:59.408 --> 00:45:59.928
<v Arnab Roy>On.</v>

00:46:01.398 --> 00:46:04.828
I mean,
this is important that we mentioned what

00:46:04.828 --> 00:46:05.328
<v Tanya>prizings we I mean amounts we earn.</v>

00:46:05.328 --> 00:46:07.838
Yes, it's a. It's a great idea to,
you know, that comparison thing.

00:46:07.838 --> 00:46:08.768
<v Tanya>Yeah. OK.</v>

00:46:08.768 --> 00:46:10.928
<v Arnab Roy>It kind of, yeah. It slipped my head.</v>

00:46:12.088 --> 00:46:14.978
Where you you you give the reasoning,
the justification,

00:46:14.978 --> 00:46:15.358
because in the end it all comes down to
price,

00:46:15.358 --> 00:46:15.758
<v Tanya>Thank you.</v>

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:21.314
only their own whole reason person is
coming here is other than having a good

00:46:21.314 --> 00:46:23.088
<v Arnab Roy>access to doctor is also the price.</v>

00:46:23.388 --> 00:46:25.328
<v Tanya>Yeah, it makes sense.</v>

00:46:25.328 --> 00:46:28.048
<v Arnab Roy>So yeah. Understood. Understood. So.</v>

00:46:29.888 --> 00:46:32.568
<v Arnab Roy>Yeah, that's the logins I think.</v>

00:46:33.568 --> 00:46:33.888
<v Arnab Roy>So what?</v>

00:46:33.888 --> 00:46:38.043
We are keeping it separate, right?
Like there is a provision for existing

00:46:38.043 --> 00:46:40.008
<v Arnab Roy>members to jump easily, but we are.</v>

00:46:40.008 --> 00:46:43.478
We are also keeping fresh logins for
people who are who don't want to be

00:46:43.478 --> 00:46:43.958
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:46:45.164 --> 00:46:47.918
<v Arnab Roy>associated with Hu, but rather with th.</v>

00:46:48.678 --> 00:46:51.111
So see,
The thing is just about keeping options

00:46:51.111 --> 00:46:54.558
open 'cause you never know like how
exactly patients would respond.

00:46:57.298 --> 00:46:58.938
<v Arnab Roy>In terms of what they need.</v>

00:47:00.488 --> 00:47:02.923
So,
because we cannot anticipate that we keep

00:47:02.923 --> 00:47:03.928
<v Arnab Roy>these options open.</v>

00:47:05.608 --> 00:47:06.098
Let that be in a separate lock,
and if he wants to enter through TH OK

00:47:06.098 --> 00:47:06.258
<v Faisal Qayoom>Help.</v>

00:47:06.498 --> 00:47:07.138
<v Tanya>Note.</v>

00:47:09.083 --> 00:47:10.648
<v Arnab Roy>fine. He gets a link, he enters.</v>

00:47:13.168 --> 00:47:14.638
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK, Arnab, I have one question so.</v>

00:47:14.638 --> 00:47:16.058
For now,
for shelter if that is feasible for you

00:47:16.058 --> 00:47:16.618
<v Arnab Roy>Battle.</v>

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.873
that you know,
we can keep it separate and if needed,

00:47:21.873 --> 00:47:26.438
we might have to provide a unique code
for the patients as well.

00:47:26.438 --> 00:47:29.238
So it will be easier for you guys also or
or if without that if it's a unique code

00:47:29.238 --> 00:47:30.598
<v Arnab Roy>Unicode would help, huh?</v>

00:47:31.051 --> 00:47:32.248
would help like for the doctors we have,
we should have for the patient also I

00:47:32.248 --> 00:47:32.368
<v Arnab Roy>Uni.</v>

00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:35.718
<v Tanya>mean.</v>

00:47:36.028 --> 00:47:39.156
Unicode would help for the patient in
those places where where we don't want

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:41.268
them to go through the hassle of
registering again.

00:47:41.468 --> 00:47:42.148
<v Tanya>Yeah, exactly.</v>

00:47:42.148 --> 00:47:43.608
<v Tanya>That's what I'm saying.</v>

00:47:43.608 --> 00:47:44.548
And it works for both experts and
patients.

00:47:44.548 --> 00:47:45.508
<v Tanya>I understand time dating.</v>

00:47:45.508 --> 00:47:46.468
<v Tanya>We can definitely do that.</v>

00:47:47.527 --> 00:47:50.268
If a patient gives his Hu member code TK
URL, you're already there in our database.

00:47:50.268 --> 00:47:50.508
<v Tanya>Replay.</v>

00:47:55.008 --> 00:47:55.768
<v Arnab Roy>Welcome to th.</v>

00:47:57.418 --> 00:47:58.338
<v Tanya>Yes, exactly.</v>

00:47:59.448 --> 00:48:03.271
And and actually the same thing is being
followed by the doctors.

00:48:03.271 --> 00:48:06.688
If there is a unique code,
they get access into th faster.

00:48:09.078 --> 00:48:09.958
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>
I don't know Faisal.

00:48:10.028 --> 00:48:12.818
Left or something. Rachel.
Not there on the call, it seems like.

00:48:12.818 --> 00:48:17.078
Yeah, HR texted him,
which has texted the group that I need to

00:48:17.078 --> 00:48:18.498
<v Shankar S>jump for in the call.</v>

00:48:19.258 --> 00:48:19.918
Call. Hey,
everyone else knows what is going on.

00:48:19.918 --> 00:48:20.278
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:48:22.838 --> 00:48:23.038
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>

00:48:24.808 --> 00:48:27.511
That's OK.
When she has seen most of the things,

00:48:27.511 --> 00:48:29.388
so maybe you can share the link.
So we'll discuss internally with that and

00:48:29.388 --> 00:48:30.268
<v Arnab Roy>I'll share the links.</v>

00:48:31.647 --> 00:48:32.088
<v Tanya>also OK.</v>

00:48:33.648 --> 00:48:35.448
Obviously this needs more,
much more discussions.

00:48:35.688 --> 00:48:38.208
We are just we looked at it for for the
first time and so many conclusions are

00:48:38.208 --> 00:48:39.964
No, but The thing is. See for for and you,
Tanya,

00:48:39.964 --> 00:48:40.288
<v Tanya>there.</v>

00:48:41.721 --> 00:48:46.078
this has been seen by Arpan and verified
the doubts which you're having.

00:48:46.078 --> 00:48:46.598
<v Tanya>OK, OK.</v>

00:48:46.848 --> 00:48:48.168
Yeah,
few few corrections like that comparison

00:48:48.168 --> 00:48:49.893
<v Tanya>Yeah. Well, you see those things, yeah.</v>

00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:52.048
thing and all correct.
But the main flow is.

00:48:52.048 --> 00:48:52.648
<v Tanya>Yeah, these things.</v>

00:48:52.648 --> 00:48:57.670
So I have also seen this flow thing like
you know a few things that I noticed and

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:58.998
<v Tanya>I thought this means attention.</v>

00:48:58.998 --> 00:48:59.568
<v Arnab Roy>These flow is already like confirmed like.</v>

00:48:59.568 --> 00:49:01.808
<v Tanya>So yeah, this whole thing is fine.</v>

00:49:01.888 --> 00:49:03.088
<v Tanya>Yeah, I also seen this before. Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:49:03.088 --> 00:49:04.008
<v Arnab Roy>We have our favorites.</v>

00:49:04.008 --> 00:49:07.588
We have our profile settings. Yeah,
and what I wanted to actually show you

00:49:07.588 --> 00:49:09.688
guys today was this thing that is the
more.

00:49:10.288 --> 00:49:13.968
And that is what Shankar's team will also
be prioritizing on prioritizing on.

00:49:13.968 --> 00:49:15.888
<v Arnab Roy>First, that is the merged.</v>

00:49:19.088 --> 00:49:19.608
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

00:49:19.688 --> 00:49:24.408
So Shankar, Faisal,
you had something which questions that?

00:49:25.468 --> 00:49:30.111
And so I was just asking if the patient
will register in the DH,

00:49:30.111 --> 00:49:30.668
<v Faisal Qayoom>will he be able to access the Hu?</v>

00:49:30.668 --> 00:49:30.788
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:49:34.028 --> 00:49:37.468
Not unless he registers himself into Hu,
right?

00:49:39.458 --> 00:49:40.528
<v Arnab Roy>Th maybe to a unique pitch.</v>

00:49:40.528 --> 00:49:46.247
We can also give the same thing, Arnab,
that on if someone has just registered on

00:49:46.247 --> 00:49:48.408
<v Tanya>th, then we can have an option.</v>

00:49:48.528 --> 00:49:50.588
From there you can go to Hu like they
should know that we just like.

00:49:50.588 --> 00:49:50.748
<v Arnab Roy>Hu And then th maybe like member code.</v>

00:49:50.748 --> 00:49:53.989
So at that time,
see right now what we are planning is

00:49:53.989 --> 00:49:55.108
<v Shankar S>like just a minute.</v>

00:49:55.348 --> 00:49:58.068
So right now what we are planning is like
having a unique code, right?

00:49:58.068 --> 00:50:02.788
So when we create a a user in the th
having some unique code then only we can

00:50:02.788 --> 00:50:02.988
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

00:50:03.157 --> 00:50:06.548
import it.
Then he right if the Unicode will be only

00:50:06.548 --> 00:50:06.615
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:50:06.615 --> 00:50:10.726
once and how can we have it?
There will be two unique codes on

00:50:10.726 --> 00:50:11.748
<v Shankar S>respective applications we can.</v>

00:50:11.748 --> 00:50:15.401
Hey, Shankar,
I got I got th may suppose he did not

00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:17.208
<v Arnab Roy>create anything in Hu, right?</v>

00:50:17.208 --> 00:50:17.638
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm mm hmm.</v>

00:50:17.638 --> 00:50:19.558
<v Arnab Roy>He created something in th.</v>

00:50:21.288 --> 00:50:27.888
So th the code that th gives would also
be compatible with Hu, right?

00:50:27.998 --> 00:50:29.748
<v Arnab Roy>That's ideally how it should be, no?</v>

00:50:29.748 --> 00:50:30.708
<v Tanya>Yeah, exactly.</v>

00:50:30.828 --> 00:50:31.278
Yeah, yeah,
that's what I was trying to say.

00:50:31.278 --> 00:50:31.758
<v Shankar S>OK.</v>

00:50:33.098 --> 00:50:33.568
And in the same way to say that is also
compatible with both the both the code

00:50:33.568 --> 00:50:34.528
<v Shankar S>What should we?</v>

00:50:39.159 --> 00:50:39.528
generation things are compatible with
both the platforms.

00:50:39.528 --> 00:50:39.688
<v Tanya>No.</v>

00:50:43.609 --> 00:50:45.038
Can you like can something like this be
done?

00:50:45.038 --> 00:50:49.932
You want getting things can like.
I'm not getting clear on this,

00:50:49.932 --> 00:50:51.208
<v Shankar S>so kind of can just.</v>

00:50:51.208 --> 00:50:53.168
<v Arnab Roy>So so see The thing is th Hu.</v>

00:50:53.488 --> 00:50:55.428
He creates profile whenever a person
creates a profile or registers themselves.

00:50:55.428 --> 00:50:55.628
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>

00:50:57.983 --> 00:50:58.488
<v Arnab Roy>They are.</v>

00:50:58.488 --> 00:51:00.758
They are assigned a member code on the Hu
right, like they're given a member code.

00:51:00.758 --> 00:51:03.033
<v Shankar S>On the Hu, OK.</v>

00:51:03.033 --> 00:51:05.989
For example,
like you're saying you don't have member

00:51:05.989 --> 00:51:07.248
<v Arnab Roy>codes right now, right?</v>

00:51:07.408 --> 00:51:10.856
But in a scenario where you do have
patient profile,

00:51:10.856 --> 00:51:13.328
<v Arnab Roy>create care member code was generated.</v>

00:51:13.328 --> 00:51:13.758
He has a member code now if he forgot,
forgets his member code,

00:51:13.758 --> 00:51:13.878
<v Shankar S>Hmm.</v>

00:51:16.708 --> 00:51:20.088
he can see it in his profile set profile
settings section pair.

00:51:20.618 --> 00:51:20.728
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>

00:51:20.728 --> 00:51:23.558
Now that member code,
once he gets into th,

00:51:23.558 --> 00:51:25.808
<v Arnab Roy>if he gives that member code again.</v>

00:51:26.968 --> 00:51:31.368
It syncs his profile because yes,
the th has recognized because they're

00:51:31.368 --> 00:51:33.568
<v Arnab Roy>both part of the same main database.</v>

00:51:33.568 --> 00:51:34.678
Probably so then recognized it and and so
this thing would also happen vice versa

00:51:34.678 --> 00:51:34.878
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm.</v>

00:51:34.938 --> 00:51:35.658
<v Tanya>Thank you for calling.</v>

00:51:38.618 --> 00:51:42.128
for th he I go into th I haven't created
anything in Hu.

00:51:42.128 --> 00:51:42.968
I go into th the moment I create a th
profile. I given a member code.

00:51:42.968 --> 00:51:43.168
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm.</v>

00:51:47.468 --> 00:51:47.938
<v Shankar S>Of what?</v>

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:48.108
But that no,
it'll be give a different kind of it it.

00:51:48.108 --> 00:51:51.788
Like whether we are same member code for
which we give it to.

00:51:54.448 --> 00:51:57.968
Give us certain alpha numeric designation
to it.

00:51:57.968 --> 00:52:01.888
No, like so that it it applies to both.
So basically the codes are coming from

00:52:01.888 --> 00:52:02.328
<v Shankar S>See.</v>

00:52:02.742 --> 00:52:03.648
<v Arnab Roy>the same place.</v>

00:52:04.678 --> 00:52:05.278
<v Shankar S>What? What?</v>

00:52:05.278 --> 00:52:10.101
My question is like see when we have a
e-mail ID which is unique.

00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:16.019
OK let's say let's take it as a e-mail as
a member code OK which will be same OK

00:52:16.019 --> 00:52:19.599
when he log in yrth the e-mail is
registered in.

00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:21.718
<v Shankar S>If it is registered in TH OK.</v>

00:52:23.478 --> 00:52:29.277
Then he can directly import in Hu OK,
because we have a unique e-mail address

00:52:29.277 --> 00:52:34.779
that will be same for both application
even if he's coming from Hu to th.

00:52:34.779 --> 00:52:35.678
<v Shankar S>Why I emailed we can do it but when we.</v>

00:52:35.678 --> 00:52:38.772
Oh,
so you're saying no need for no need for

00:52:38.772 --> 00:52:39.248
<v Arnab Roy>code emails it was.</v>

00:52:39.248 --> 00:52:40.368
<v Shankar S>No need for e-mail.</v>

00:52:40.568 --> 00:52:44.885
E-mail is more than enough.
e-mail can be done more than enough

00:52:44.885 --> 00:52:49.808
e-mail because somehow the credentials
remain same in both applications.

00:52:50.488 --> 00:52:53.460
Right.
If the name is registered as a Shankar in

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.128
Hu,
the same name will be registered in TH.

00:52:57.538 --> 00:53:00.997
Right.
I can't change my name in th the same

00:53:00.997 --> 00:53:06.838
ways if the e-mail is registered once,
we can be used in both applications.

00:53:06.838 --> 00:53:08.548
No need of creating a member new member
code and it will make. Yeah,

00:53:08.548 --> 00:53:10.868
<v Arnab Roy>Ah, I I mean that also works, right?</v>

00:53:11.475 --> 00:53:16.447
it will make easier because when we
create from th then we have to keep a

00:53:16.447 --> 00:53:18.798
<v Shankar S>member code which is similar to Hu.</v>

00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:23.928
Let's say HU01 is when the user
registered in health unwired,

00:53:23.928 --> 00:53:24.768
<v Shankar S>it comes as member will come as Hu but.</v>

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:24.888
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

00:53:27.688 --> 00:53:30.608
When he creates from th same member code
will not be generated.

00:53:30.608 --> 00:53:33.798
It might come like th .01,
so here member code conflict will come.

00:53:33.798 --> 00:53:34.438
<v Arnab Roy>A church.</v>

00:53:36.718 --> 00:53:40.758
Instead of that we can have an e-mail ID
as a unique code.

00:53:40.838 --> 00:53:45.518
We can import the details from here and
then vice versa with both applications.

00:53:47.598 --> 00:53:48.088
That's what what the Zomato and district,
which comes under the same organization,

00:53:48.088 --> 00:53:48.768
<v Arnab Roy>OK.</v>

00:53:52.178 --> 00:53:52.294
<v Arnab Roy>Huh.</v>

00:53:52.294 --> 00:53:55.518
does the same thing.
When you register to the districts.

00:53:55.598 --> 00:53:59.689
You can see that when you give an e-mail
ID or a phone number, they gonna evaluate,

00:53:59.689 --> 00:54:02.318
evaluate with that thing and then import
the profile.

00:54:02.318 --> 00:54:03.238
<v Shankar S>Here they does the same thing.</v>

00:54:03.238 --> 00:54:07.178
So then e-mail ID is a good thing to go
with, right?

00:54:07.178 --> 00:54:07.598
<v Shankar S>Yeah, e-mail address more than now.</v>

00:54:07.598 --> 00:54:09.758
<v Arnab Roy>As As for then that's it.</v>

00:54:09.758 --> 00:54:11.078
<v Arnab Roy>No. Then Hogan, if his e-mail ID.</v>

00:54:11.078 --> 00:54:11.118
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>

00:54:11.118 --> 00:54:14.058
So, Shankar,
are you suggesting the same for the

00:54:14.058 --> 00:54:15.298
<v Tanya>doctors or just the patients?</v>

00:54:15.298 --> 00:54:16.178
<v Shankar S>We can do it.</v>

00:54:16.298 --> 00:54:18.208
We can do it the same thing for, you know,
doctors.

00:54:18.208 --> 00:54:21.368
<v Arnab Roy>Doctors. But I think we can remove it.</v>

00:54:21.888 --> 00:54:22.388
<v Shankar S>No, code is fine.</v>

00:54:22.388 --> 00:54:23.088
<v Tanya>Yeah, that's what.</v>

00:54:23.088 --> 00:54:25.448
One or the other day we can have it a
code.

00:54:25.678 --> 00:54:25.768
<v Arnab Roy>Health unwired member code OK.</v>

00:54:25.768 --> 00:54:29.768
We we are not sure,
see right now in the doctor thing.

00:54:29.768 --> 00:54:30.088
<v Tanya>Thank you.</v>

00:54:31.088 --> 00:54:34.368
<v Shankar S>We are not registering the doctor via pH.</v>

00:54:34.928 --> 00:54:37.208
<v Shankar S>Are we doing that or not?</v>

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:41.818
We are registering Dr. via this,
so see this is what phase one is

00:54:41.818 --> 00:54:42.468
<v Arnab Roy>according to.</v>

00:54:42.468 --> 00:54:43.068
<v Shankar S>No, no.</v>

00:54:43.068 --> 00:54:47.748
So what I'm asking is like the doctor
will come only from Hu.

00:54:48.068 --> 00:54:49.058
<v Shankar S>There is no way that doctor cannot.</v>

00:54:49.058 --> 00:54:50.018
<v Arnab Roy>Yes, yes. No.</v>

00:54:51.568 --> 00:54:52.128
<v Arnab Roy>Not now.</v>

00:54:52.128 --> 00:54:52.688
<v Shankar S>Come from th.</v>

00:54:52.968 --> 00:54:53.608
<v Arnab Roy>Not now.</v>

00:54:53.608 --> 00:54:54.848
<v Arnab Roy>It's not forever.</v>

00:54:54.848 --> 00:54:58.325
For now, yes,
there is no way a doctor can come through

00:54:58.325 --> 00:54:58.408
<v Arnab Roy>th he only.</v>

00:54:58.408 --> 00:54:59.808
<v Shankar S>Then let's keep it simple.</v>

00:55:00.248 --> 00:55:00.768
<v Shankar S>Then let's keep it simple then.</v>

00:55:00.768 --> 00:55:02.368
But that is only but,
but that is only for now.

00:55:02.368 --> 00:55:03.188
We have to be prepared key in the future.
Doctors would be able to come separately

00:55:03.188 --> 00:55:06.746
<v Shankar S>Hmm. Hmm. Right.</v>

00:55:06.746 --> 00:55:07.168
<v Arnab Roy>into th.</v>

00:55:07.648 --> 00:55:12.696
Yeah, yeah. Even if if the if the case,
then we can have a have a e-mail ID as a

00:55:12.696 --> 00:55:16.934
thing and we can have it.
The details here and then this will works

00:55:16.934 --> 00:55:21.488
easier for us as well and to keep it
Vinay, you know smaller thing we can.

00:55:21.488 --> 00:55:21.608
See right now right now the flow of a
doctor is like this.

00:55:21.608 --> 00:55:22.568
<v Shankar S>Have to e-mail it is.</v>

00:55:25.408 --> 00:55:26.688
<v Arnab Roy>He's into his cancer.</v>

00:55:26.728 --> 00:55:28.168
<v Arnab Roy>Sorry, health, unwired, dance, rout.</v>

00:55:29.728 --> 00:55:30.368
<v Arnab Roy>And he gets this.</v>

00:55:30.528 --> 00:55:31.568
<v Arnab Roy>Add your hospital thing right?</v>

00:55:33.248 --> 00:55:35.088
<v Arnab Roy>Based on that, his journey starts.</v>

00:55:36.728 --> 00:55:40.078
So where he registers himself full name,
health, unwired,

00:55:40.078 --> 00:55:41.168
member code or something like that,
and he can either log in now and directly

00:55:41.168 --> 00:55:41.288
<v Shankar S>Hmm.</v>

00:55:44.582 --> 00:55:46.198
<v Arnab Roy>go to his dashboard because.</v>

00:55:47.808 --> 00:55:48.768
<v Arnab Roy>He, like I don't know.</v>

00:55:49.048 --> 00:55:50.448
<v Arnab Roy>He wants to come as a separate doctor.</v>

00:55:50.448 --> 00:55:52.919
Into it or he wants to continue the
registration.

00:55:52.919 --> 00:55:53.108
<v Arnab Roy>This is where he adds his hospital.</v>

00:55:53.108 --> 00:55:55.738
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm. Correct. Correct.</v>

00:55:56.018 --> 00:55:56.208
<v Shankar S>So the thing here is like.</v>

00:55:56.208 --> 00:55:56.788
<v Arnab Roy>So based on that.</v>

00:55:56.788 --> 00:55:58.748
<v Faisal Qayoom>So so can you?</v>

00:55:59.188 --> 00:56:00.788
<v Faisal Qayoom>Can you go to that page again?</v>

00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:02.468
<v Faisal Qayoom>Registration page please.</v>

00:56:07.088 --> 00:56:10.486
Yeah,
so here you have mentioned that continue

00:56:10.486 --> 00:56:14.518
registration and login,
so this this expert is already registered.

00:56:14.518 --> 00:56:16.838
I know. Yeah, yeah,
I know this part is already there.

00:56:17.158 --> 00:56:18.518
<v Arnab Roy>Again, I'm just keeping this.</v>

00:56:18.638 --> 00:56:22.208
Probably he will just go into the login
part which is this page, right?

00:56:22.208 --> 00:56:24.688
<v Faisal Qayoom>Yes, not even log in.</v>

00:56:24.688 --> 00:56:25.448
<v Faisal Qayoom>I think he should not be.</v>

00:56:25.448 --> 00:56:26.328
<v Arnab Roy>Or he'll be logged in.</v>

00:56:27.288 --> 00:56:28.128
<v Faisal Qayoom>Yeah, directly into the application.</v>

00:56:28.128 --> 00:56:28.808
<v Arnab Roy>At your hospital, Sir.</v>

00:56:28.808 --> 00:56:30.728
Directly at your hospital can process
through.

00:56:31.048 --> 00:56:31.818
<v Arnab Roy>I'm keeping these pages separate.</v>

00:56:31.818 --> 00:56:35.138
No, no. Even if it is there,
it has to go through from login itself.

00:56:35.138 --> 00:56:40.178
This is what we will keep it things OK.
I will make sure that how it has to come.

00:56:40.178 --> 00:56:44.098
I can I can explain on that but yeah
process will be from if it is already

00:56:44.098 --> 00:56:44.788
I also had something like this in mind,
but I don't know whether this makes sense.

00:56:44.788 --> 00:56:45.218
<v Shankar S>logged.</v>

00:56:47.698 --> 00:56:48.738
<v Arnab Roy>It doesn't make sense, I feel.</v>

00:56:49.538 --> 00:56:49.738
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm.</v>

00:56:50.328 --> 00:56:53.328
We are not keeping things two separate,
right?

00:56:53.448 --> 00:56:53.738
Because I thought at one point of time,
if he if a doctor for only for doctor not,

00:56:53.738 --> 00:56:53.938
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm.</v>

00:56:58.353 --> 00:57:02.578
this is not applicable to patients and
all only for doctors like when they log

00:57:02.578 --> 00:57:03.022
<v Shankar S>Pardon.</v>

00:57:03.022 --> 00:57:07.428
out and all the next time they get into
the first they get this page so whether.

00:57:07.428 --> 00:57:07.808
OK.
Irrespective irrespective domain is like

00:57:07.808 --> 00:57:08.808
<v Arnab Roy>You want to log in to.</v>

00:57:10.488 --> 00:57:13.178
treatment or hospital or it might be a
health unwired.

00:57:13.178 --> 00:57:13.658
<v Arnab Roy>Help.</v>

00:57:14.228 --> 00:57:16.568
<v Shankar S>So this page will be the long page.</v>

00:57:16.568 --> 00:57:19.248
This from here I can go to my respective
login.

00:57:19.878 --> 00:57:20.008
<v Shankar S>OK.</v>

00:57:20.008 --> 00:57:23.808
So you guys can decide where you guys
wanna put this or not have this at all?

00:57:23.808 --> 00:57:24.568
That's your guys decision functionality
wise. So yeah.

00:57:24.568 --> 00:57:24.768
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm.</v>

00:57:29.658 --> 00:57:29.728
<v Shankar S>That one we can see that later.</v>

00:57:29.728 --> 00:57:31.228
Considering that these two processes are
not needed.

00:57:31.228 --> 00:57:33.748
So when when that when that page will
come?

00:57:34.898 --> 00:57:35.828
<v Arnab Roy>Yep, it's missus ha.</v>

00:57:35.828 --> 00:57:36.288
<v Tanya>So you're saying I love that first?</v>

00:57:36.288 --> 00:57:36.408
<v Faisal Qayoom>Hmm.</v>

00:57:39.988 --> 00:57:43.000
The doctor's log, I mean,
gets on this platform,

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.978
<v Tanya>so he will see this screen first.</v>

00:57:44.978 --> 00:57:47.213
That is,
that is already when a doctor has both

00:57:47.213 --> 00:57:48.478
profiles,
like he's a he's a Doctor Who has

00:57:48.478 --> 00:57:49.261
<v Tanya>OK. OK. OK.</v>

00:57:49.261 --> 00:57:52.168
treatment or hospital profile,
and he has a health unwired profile also.

00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:54.608
Then I I think then in that case this
makes sense.

00:57:55.938 --> 00:57:58.884
So next time,
like and after he's a part of both places,

00:57:58.884 --> 00:58:01.248
if he has logged out and all and
everything, and next time he goes,

00:58:01.248 --> 00:58:01.768
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

00:58:02.398 --> 00:58:04.258
<v Arnab Roy>he's greeted with this screen first.</v>

00:58:05.498 --> 00:58:06.688
<v Tanya>Mm hmm. Oh, OK, that is just make sense.</v>

00:58:06.688 --> 00:58:08.248
<v Arnab Roy>Treatment janaya help me.</v>

00:58:10.078 --> 00:58:13.265
See whenever, say this,
there is a catch in this.

00:58:13.265 --> 00:58:17.280
Whenever the user logs in, see.
Either we need to show it one,

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.968
either we keep it this or keep it,
whichever we have it in the health unwant.

00:58:20.968 --> 00:58:22.251
I've kept it for so that you guys can
decide on the functionality wise.

00:58:22.251 --> 00:58:23.398
<v Shankar S>So we can't. Yeah.</v>

00:58:24.368 --> 00:58:25.968
Which one is easier?
You wanna go via this?

00:58:25.968 --> 00:58:26.168
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>

00:58:26.888 --> 00:58:27.088
See user wise man this this is very
simplistic. Even as a doctor I know. OK,

00:58:27.088 --> 00:58:27.288
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

00:58:27.968 --> 00:58:28.128
<v Shankar S>With.</v>

00:58:30.138 --> 00:58:30.338
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm.</v>

00:58:31.651 --> 00:58:36.043
I wanna go to this platform.
Now if you can eliminate this section and

00:58:36.043 --> 00:58:39.012
make that process easier,
you can do that also.

00:58:39.012 --> 00:58:39.688
<v Arnab Roy>What do you guys have to?</v>

00:58:39.688 --> 00:58:43.882
See my my suggestion would be let's keep
it this login so that even if there is a

00:58:43.882 --> 00:58:44.468
new Doctor,
we'll get to know about the th so he can

00:58:44.468 --> 00:58:44.788
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:58:46.592 --> 00:58:47.768
<v Shankar S>go through the process.</v>

00:58:47.808 --> 00:58:52.669
So whatever the earlier lock in is there,
we can take it out this and keep it this

00:58:52.669 --> 00:58:53.258
<v Shankar S>as a constant.</v>

00:58:53.258 --> 00:58:53.338
<v Arnab Roy>Yetin.</v>

00:58:53.338 --> 00:58:53.978
<v Tanya>But Shankar?</v>

00:58:53.978 --> 00:58:55.458
<v Tanya>Oh, no, no, Shankar.</v>

00:58:55.738 --> 00:58:58.738
But if there's a new Doctor,
he won't be seeing this screen, right?

00:58:58.978 --> 00:59:00.238
Only those doctors can see who have both
the profiles. So.

00:59:00.238 --> 00:59:02.968
That's what see in what happens with
login is like whenever we have the

00:59:02.968 --> 00:59:03.608
<v Arnab Roy>They both clear.</v>

00:59:06.249 --> 00:59:10.757
accounts on two things,
two platforms like th and Hu,

00:59:10.757 --> 00:59:17.018
we can't identify the doctor that we
wanted to show this page to the user.

00:59:17.538 --> 00:59:18.738
<v Shankar S>Let's say I'm a doctor.</v>

00:59:18.938 --> 00:59:22.798
I have an account in only health unwired.
While in the domain we can't show that

00:59:22.798 --> 00:59:23.038
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

00:59:24.079 --> 00:59:27.378
whenever the user logins with the doctor
let's say.

00:59:28.168 --> 00:59:31.902
You know, he has that word.
com when when he tried to put that expert.

00:59:31.902 --> 00:59:34.689
healthunver.
com the first thing it will see whether

00:59:34.689 --> 00:59:37.161
he's logged in or not when he's not
logged in,

00:59:37.161 --> 00:59:40.158
it will take to the login page when he
has both account.

00:59:40.358 --> 00:59:45.008
We can't differentiate that to navigate
to this login page,

00:59:45.008 --> 00:59:50.898
whichever is like both th and this will
become conflicts and which is quite

00:59:50.898 --> 00:59:51.518
<v Shankar S>notable.</v>

00:59:51.518 --> 00:59:54.667
I can do research on that, but yeah,
it's not doable cause of my knowledge

00:59:54.667 --> 00:59:54.918
<v Shankar S>right?</v>

00:59:55.878 --> 00:59:56.748
<v Arnab Roy>Section option optional here.</v>

00:59:56.748 --> 00:59:57.068
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>

00:59:58.718 --> 00:59:59.598
<v Arnab Roy>This is optional.</v>

01:00:00.718 --> 01:00:03.368
Now you guys decide based on your,
you know feasibility whether you want

01:00:03.368 --> 01:00:03.648
<v Shankar S>Yeah.</v>

01:00:04.303 --> 01:00:04.938
<v Arnab Roy>these sections or not other.</v>

01:00:04.938 --> 01:00:06.098
<v Tanya>And what is the screen?</v>

01:00:07.648 --> 01:00:09.378
This doctor register where it's written.
No, no, no.

01:00:09.378 --> 01:00:12.178
Yeah, flow, this is,
this is where the doctor adds this.

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:13.258
<v Arnab Roy>Which one?</v>

01:00:13.258 --> 01:00:13.348
<v Arnab Roy>You're talking about this flow, right?</v>

01:00:13.348 --> 01:00:14.228
<v Tanya>OK. OK. OK.</v>

01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:16.628
<v Tanya>Yeah, just below this.</v>

01:00:16.628 --> 01:00:17.408
<v Tanya>Yeah. Doctor, Register one. OK.</v>

01:00:17.408 --> 01:00:21.598
So this is basically doctor registering
their hospitals because as Arpan said

01:00:21.598 --> 01:00:21.848
again we have to,
we have to always make sure that the main

01:00:21.848 --> 01:00:22.688
<v Tanya>OK. OK. OK.</v>

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:24.821
<v Tanya>Go on. OK, babe? Yeah.</v>

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:28.312
requirement is being fulfilled.
That is doctors do not come into

01:00:28.312 --> 01:00:30.568
<v Arnab Roy>treatment at hospital without an hospital.</v>

01:00:31.948 --> 01:00:32.278
<v Tanya>Yeah, I'll just.</v>

01:00:32.278 --> 01:00:32.678
<v Arnab Roy>I can't.</v>

01:00:32.758 --> 01:00:36.278
I can't just create a doctor profile
inside inside treatment hospital.

01:00:36.678 --> 01:00:42.078
No hospital creates the doctor profile,
so I add a hospital.

01:00:42.078 --> 01:00:43.118
<v Arnab Roy>This is where this is again.</v>

01:00:43.118 --> 01:00:45.722
This is the,
you know subscription part which arpanas

01:00:45.722 --> 01:00:47.298
talking about.
But let's consider I took premium support.

01:00:47.298 --> 01:00:47.898
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

01:00:48.518 --> 01:00:50.638
<v Arnab Roy>So this is this is a thing.</v>

01:00:50.878 --> 01:00:52.518
<v Arnab Roy>So there are two flows out here.</v>

01:00:52.518 --> 01:00:53.518
<v Arnab Roy>I'll go through both.</v>

01:00:53.518 --> 01:00:54.868
So I'm trying to make this as simple as
possible. What?

01:00:54.868 --> 01:00:55.428
<v Tanya>Mone.</v>
Arnab.

01:00:57.008 --> 01:00:59.757
Arnab,
I think we can go with this flow with

01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:02.688
Richa as well.
So she might have some input so.

01:01:05.008 --> 01:01:05.378
<v Shankar S>That's what I feel if we want.</v>

01:01:05.378 --> 01:01:05.898
<v Arnab Roy>I don't know.</v>

01:01:07.778 --> 01:01:12.605
So I don't know one thing that you shared
the whole flow for treatment dot hospital

01:01:12.605 --> 01:01:16.178
and we'll go through this and whatever we
see like we'll let you know like what?

01:01:16.178 --> 01:01:19.749
Now what you guys won't understand it
properly unless I I actually explain it

01:01:19.749 --> 01:01:20.228
<v Arnab Roy>to you guys.</v>

01:01:20.228 --> 01:01:21.128
<v Tanya>Oh. Oh, OK.</v>

01:01:21.128 --> 01:01:25.578
One explanation is needed on the whole
design and then later you can have some

01:01:25.578 --> 01:01:27.088
you know,
go through and have some questions.

01:01:27.088 --> 01:01:29.888
Then return need to have another call and
1st see the whole flow.

01:01:29.888 --> 01:01:30.488
<v Shankar S>Yeah, and.</v>

01:01:31.575 --> 01:01:36.468
Without interrupting that we should have
this or that because that's like the way

01:01:36.468 --> 01:01:36.948
<v Arnab Roy>I knew.</v>

01:01:36.948 --> 01:01:37.149
I knew this this discussion.
This discussion is never gonna be

01:01:37.149 --> 01:01:38.168
<v Tanya>our discussion.</v>

01:01:40.003 --> 01:01:41.128
<v Arnab Roy>finished within one within one call.</v>

01:01:41.128 --> 01:01:42.008
<v Shankar S>Yeah, it.</v>

01:01:42.008 --> 01:01:42.428
<v Shankar S>One call it never gonna happen.</v>

01:01:42.428 --> 01:01:42.748
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:01:43.328 --> 01:01:43.488
It's a series of calls which will happen,
but The thing is I am also might not be

There are certain things which needs

01:02:36.088 --> 01:02:37.928
<v Tanya>She already has that time crunch.</v>

01:02:39.478 --> 01:02:42.918
Because you guys need to understand this
part.

01:02:42.918 --> 01:02:45.198
<v Tanya>I'll confirm with her. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:45.688
<v Arnab Roy>Take care.</v>

01:02:45.968 --> 01:02:46.808
So probably coming week may again we can

01:02:46.808 --> 01:02:46.848
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:51.488
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

01:02:54.368 --> 01:02:57.728
<v Arnab Roy>'Cause I also it's OK till then.</v>

01:02:57.728 --> 01:03:01.692
Probably I can do some changes right
which which I had mentioned this price

01:03:01.692 --> 01:03:01.788
range things on the speciality cards as
well as the giving the treatment records

01:03:01.788 --> 01:03:02.788
<v Tanya>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

01:03:02.788 --> 01:03:04.068
<v Tanya>Try fish things.</v>

01:03:04.068 --> 01:03:04.588
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:03:05.917 --> 01:03:08.208
of the specific doctor X number of
treatments that a person has done.

01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:09.608
<v Tanya>Yeah, well.</v>

01:03:09.928 --> 01:03:12.738
I'll do those changes also in the
meantime and probably I can.

01:03:12.738 --> 01:03:13.258
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:03:13.608 --> 01:03:17.328
I'll sit with you know Shankar,
Faisal and I'll regarding the sync part.

01:03:17.328 --> 01:03:19.568
<v Tanya>Oh yeah, I have the login thing in yeah.</v>

01:03:19.688 --> 01:03:20.968
<v Arnab Roy>Confusion.</v>

01:03:21.168 --> 01:03:21.648
<v Tanya>Right.</v>

01:03:23.328 --> 01:03:23.648
<v Arnab Roy>So.</v>

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:28.065
After that,
I think Web team would probably be

01:03:28.065 --> 01:03:29.548
focusing on this part first,
because this is the main first module

01:03:29.548 --> 01:03:29.868
<v Tanya>Thank you.</v>

01:03:31.624 --> 01:03:34.333
that needs to be done.
The addition of a hospital,

01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:38.423
the addition of lead contact persons,
making sure that they all get added to

01:03:38.423 --> 01:03:38.628
<v Arnab Roy>the database if I am.</v>

01:03:38.628 --> 01:03:39.228
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:03:39.538 --> 01:03:40.578
<v Arnab Roy>Not elite contact.</v>

01:03:40.578 --> 01:03:44.698
Then how do I send a link to A to the
elite contact?

01:03:45.498 --> 01:03:49.988
This is what this process deals with.
The patient part comes very late which I

01:03:49.988 --> 01:03:50.268
<v Tanya>OK.</v>

01:03:51.168 --> 01:03:52.818
<v Arnab Roy>which you see out here.</v>

01:03:52.818 --> 01:03:54.368
The flow first is that and then second
comes the hospital admin.

01:03:54.368 --> 01:03:54.608
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:03:57.751 --> 01:04:00.458
<v Arnab Roy>Basically getting the database ready.</v>

01:04:00.458 --> 01:04:01.798
Thanks. Need to rub of her. Yeah. Yeah,
exactly.

01:04:01.798 --> 01:04:02.638
<v Arnab Roy>Both sides, he says.</v>

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.848
Matt or they call me Harris Katami
unaware.

01:04:04.848 --> 01:04:05.328
<v Faisal Qayoom>Is that?</v>

01:04:06.888 --> 01:04:07.238
We had just seen the patient part time
before.

01:04:07.238 --> 01:04:08.328
The number of so do we need to get all
the things from the doctor profile into

01:04:08.328 --> 01:04:10.808
<v Arnab Roy>Oh huh. Faizal.</v>

01:04:14.322 --> 01:04:18.528
this, like the appointments, history,
payments and all these things?

01:04:18.528 --> 01:04:24.972
I think in Hu,
I think we have this doctor's podcast,

01:04:24.972 --> 01:04:25.688
<v Arnab Roy>blogs.</v>

01:04:25.688 --> 01:04:28.288
<v Arnab Roy>Will that also come in this th thing?</v>

01:04:28.528 --> 01:04:31.918
This something, Tanya,
you can ask Arpan once he blogs, blogs,

01:04:31.918 --> 01:04:32.768
<v Tanya>Oh yeah. But I was thinking that, yeah.</v>

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:36.066
podcast,
Kobe unlock Utake language because see,

01:04:36.066 --> 01:04:39.499
we need to keep some distinctive from
what I feel.

01:04:39.499 --> 01:04:42.998
We need to keep some distinction between
th and Hu.

01:04:43.228 --> 01:04:44.028
<v Tanya>Yeah, exactly.</v>

01:04:44.028 --> 01:04:45.828
I don't think we should bring those
things.

01:04:45.828 --> 01:04:46.878
It should be like completely focused on
the treatment, yeah.

01:04:46.878 --> 01:04:50.406
Because Thu hi,
Hu Hu is a knowledge base actually other

01:04:50.406 --> 01:04:52.438
than treatment they are they are also
considered as a knowledge base because

01:04:52.438 --> 01:04:53.278
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

01:04:55.172 --> 01:04:56.048
you have you have podcast blogs,
videos and everything.

01:04:56.048 --> 01:04:56.368
<v Tanya>Fine, yeah.</v>

01:04:59.078 --> 01:05:01.558
So knowledge base or knowledge base and
this is exclusively towards come to my

01:05:01.558 --> 01:05:02.198
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.478
<v Arnab Roy>hospital and get treated.</v>

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:09.708
Exactly. And so keeping it like you know,
separate also shows that, OK,

01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:12.248
this is whole like one company only and
this is just a part of, yeah. Yeah.

01:05:12.248 --> 01:05:14.341
Hmm,
it's a whole new portal that we we are we

01:05:14.341 --> 01:05:14.841
In that case,
it would look like this is a whole new

01:05:14.841 --> 01:05:15.448
<v Arnab Roy>are giving.</v>

01:05:17.571 --> 01:05:19.278
<v Tanya>thing, and that's different.</v>

01:05:19.278 --> 01:05:22.198
<v Tanya>So this needs should not mix it up.</v>

01:05:24.298 --> 01:05:24.998
<v Arnab Roy>Or else ha ha.</v>

01:05:24.998 --> 01:05:25.318
<v Tanya>Open.</v>

01:05:25.998 --> 01:05:29.651
Another thing,
it is clear that the Doctor Who is not

01:05:29.651 --> 01:05:33.228
there in the Hu will not be on boarded in
the th right.

01:05:33.228 --> 01:05:34.548
<v Arnab Roy>Yeah, for now for now, yes.</v>

01:05:34.548 --> 01:05:36.028
First phase mail we a doctor comes only
with their hospital or medical

01:05:36.028 --> 01:05:36.148
<v Faisal Qayoom>Oh.</v>

01:05:38.318 --> 01:05:42.088
institution or else a doctor doesn't come
into th the feed cap either.

01:05:42.088 --> 01:05:45.752
When I was go th my doctor gave he
doesn't have a hospital that he's

01:05:45.752 --> 01:05:46.548
<v Arnab Roy>connected with.</v>

01:05:46.548 --> 01:05:48.628
<v Arnab Roy>I am a patient.</v>

01:05:48.628 --> 01:05:50.108
<v Arnab Roy>I'm talking to a doctor in th.</v>

01:05:50.148 --> 01:05:53.944
The only reason I'm talking to the doctor
is because the doctor is part of a

01:05:53.944 --> 01:05:57.148
specific hospital because I want to go to
that hospital one day.

01:05:58.128 --> 01:05:59.958
Right.
That's my whole intention of talking to a

01:05:59.958 --> 01:06:00.238
<v Faisal Qayoom>Yeah.</v>

01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:01.328
<v Arnab Roy>doctor in th.</v>

01:06:02.038 --> 01:06:03.998
<v Arnab Roy>But in Hu, though, the story is different.</v>

01:06:03.998 --> 01:06:04.758
<v Arnab Roy>No Hu, man.</v>

01:06:05.038 --> 01:06:08.778
I want the doctor to treat me on the call
only to treat me to give me prescription,

01:06:08.778 --> 01:06:09.658
<v Faisal Qayoom>No, for example.</v>

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:11.918
<v Arnab Roy>to take my medical reports.</v>

01:06:11.918 --> 01:06:15.475
In fact, you know,
Arthon says other company like out of

01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:16.598
<v Tanya>feeling cancelled.</v>

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:17.478
<v Tanya>They followed this.</v>

01:06:17.638 --> 01:06:21.518
Now they only.
So basically before the treatment starts,

01:06:21.518 --> 01:06:25.398
they get on like, you know,
a consultation call kind of.

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:29.351
You don't call it consultation,
but basically where the doctor is trying

01:06:29.351 --> 01:06:33.358
to understand the whole thing,
like the whole situation on on everything.

01:06:33.398 --> 01:06:36.158
<v Tanya>So when they plan the whole treatment so.</v>

01:06:37.438 --> 01:06:37.758
So that call would be like that. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

01:06:37.758 --> 01:06:43.452
So that is exactly what ths doctors do.
It's more the call is not so much about

01:06:43.452 --> 01:06:46.588
the tell me about your sickness in detail
and all. It's like,

01:06:46.588 --> 01:06:46.868
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:06:47.864 --> 01:06:48.488
tell me about your sickness and come to
my place and we will do an onsite

01:06:48.488 --> 01:06:48.568
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:06:51.588 --> 01:06:53.130
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly.</v>

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:54.838
<v Arnab Roy>treatment of you. So we.</v>

01:06:54.838 --> 01:06:57.518
Have to keep few things distinct.
We have to keep.

01:06:58.068 --> 01:06:58.868
<v Tanya>Yeah, exactly.</v>

01:06:59.088 --> 01:07:02.648
Merging everything into one umbrella will
be really confusing for the patient.

01:07:02.648 --> 01:07:02.838
<v Arnab Roy>That much I'm I guarantee, I'm sure.</v>

01:07:02.838 --> 01:07:03.958
<v Tanya>Oh yeah, I agree.</v>

01:07:06.118 --> 01:07:10.641
'Cause medical, medical, tourism,
the kind of patients that we're gonna be

01:07:10.641 --> 01:07:14.681
getting, they're a different class.
They're different demographic.

01:07:14.681 --> 01:07:18.118
Hu patients are gonna be a lot smarter
than th patients.

01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:18.238
<v Tanya>Exactly. Yeah, fine.</v>

01:07:18.238 --> 01:07:19.358
<v Arnab Roy>This is just a, it's a fact.</v>

01:07:20.838 --> 01:07:20.928
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:07:20.928 --> 01:07:22.248
<v Arnab Roy>Th patients the whole point.</v>

01:07:22.248 --> 01:07:22.848
<v Arnab Roy>They're coming.</v>

01:07:22.848 --> 01:07:25.528
They're not extremely rich,
influential people.

01:07:25.648 --> 01:07:29.547
They are normal people who want cheaper
treatment in other countries.

01:07:29.547 --> 01:07:31.998
So we we have to keep some things
distinct.

01:07:33.268 --> 01:07:33.458
<v Faisal Qayoom>So when so for example.</v>

01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:33.778
Right then the the design and the
language,

01:07:33.778 --> 01:07:36.258
<v Arnab Roy>Not everyone is not as tech savvy, right?</v>

01:07:36.437 --> 01:07:39.368
everything has to be like quite simple.
So much like, yeah.

01:07:39.368 --> 01:07:40.768
<v Arnab Roy>Simplest in fact.</v>

01:07:40.768 --> 01:07:43.518
Th has to be much more simplistic
compared to Hu.

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:44.558
<v Tanya>Yeah, exactly.</v>

01:07:44.958 --> 01:07:45.688
<v Tanya>And yeah, I think.</v>

01:07:45.688 --> 01:07:49.128
Considering the kind of people that are
gonna be using this site.

01:07:50.648 --> 01:07:50.928
<v Tanya>Exactly.</v>

01:07:50.928 --> 01:07:51.008
<v Arnab Roy>So.</v>

01:07:51.108 --> 01:07:54.158
<v Faisal Qayoom>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:07:54.158 --> 01:07:55.238
<v Faisal Qayoom>So one more thing.</v>

01:07:57.208 --> 01:08:00.278
So for example,
we have added some hospital, OK, now,

01:08:00.278 --> 01:08:00.718
<v Arnab Roy>OK.</v>

01:08:00.873 --> 01:08:04.267
now that hospital wants to onboard their
doctors,

01:08:04.267 --> 01:08:05.448
<v Faisal Qayoom>do we have the provision for that up?</v>

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:05.888
<v Arnab Roy>They do it.</v>

01:08:05.888 --> 01:08:11.408
No henna hospital admin to add doctors,
Wala Sena Jatana.

01:08:12.968 --> 01:08:13.508
Add Doctor popup and then doctors so this
is Medicare hospitals dashboard, right?

01:08:13.508 --> 01:08:13.748
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK.</v>

01:08:19.288 --> 01:08:23.558
They have their patient management,
doctor management, treatment and services,

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:26.530
hospital, hospital coordinators,
financial management,

01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:31.124
communication support, content management,
content management is basically what what

01:08:31.124 --> 01:08:34.367
shows here for the hospital profile page.
All these photos,

01:08:34.367 --> 01:08:36.528
<v Arnab Roy>these things are grabbed from that area.</v>

01:08:40.068 --> 01:08:42.868
So that means they will unwind the
doctors on Hu, right?

01:08:44.638 --> 01:08:45.918
<v Arnab Roy>Nah. Either either.</v>

01:08:45.918 --> 01:08:49.598
Th hospital admin.
This is a hospital admin.

01:08:50.318 --> 01:08:52.038
<v Arnab Roy>Hu does not have a hospital admin right.</v>

01:08:52.198 --> 01:08:53.518
<v Arnab Roy>They have doctor, admin, super admin.</v>

01:08:56.188 --> 01:08:56.608
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK.</v>

01:08:56.608 --> 01:08:58.328
<v Arnab Roy>Sorry, export admin and super admin.</v>

01:09:02.958 --> 01:09:07.738
Hospital will have an admin right to
manage all the things that are being

01:09:07.738 --> 01:09:09.998
<v Arnab Roy>shown on the hospital profile page.</v>

01:09:10.558 --> 01:09:10.858
<v Arnab Roy>All this data treatment options.</v>

01:09:10.858 --> 01:09:14.098
<v Tanya>No, this is the they will need to have.</v>

01:09:14.848 --> 01:09:15.448
<v Arnab Roy>Meta hospital.</v>

01:09:17.048 --> 01:09:17.128
<v Arnab Roy>Treatments, everything is fetched.</v>

01:09:17.128 --> 01:09:17.608
<v Tanya>Yes.</v>

01:09:20.248 --> 01:09:24.808
All these videos,
everything is fetched from this section.

01:09:25.048 --> 01:09:28.758
This can you see treatments and services.
I chose it from here,

01:09:28.758 --> 01:09:29.110
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:33.933
quotation creator for the medical
coordinators to give or the hospital also

01:09:33.933 --> 01:09:37.423
can give a quotation based on what the
customer wants.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:41.888
And then hospital coordinators also.
I can keep a track of and then I.

01:09:41.888 --> 01:09:44.408
<v Faisal Qayoom>Padnabad I think.</v>

01:09:44.768 --> 01:09:48.012
See for example I have added one hospital
OK,

01:09:48.012 --> 01:09:48.688
as an expert I have added the hospital.
Now that hospital wants to onboard their

01:09:48.688 --> 01:09:49.208
<v Arnab Roy>Yes.</v>

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:54.568
<v Faisal Qayoom>doctors. OK.</v>

01:09:54.728 --> 01:09:54.998
<v Faisal Qayoom>Let me finish it.</v>

01:09:54.998 --> 01:09:55.558
<v Arnab Roy>Yes.</v>

01:09:55.648 --> 01:09:57.568
<v Faisal Qayoom>So where they will onboard their doctors?</v>

01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:57.648
<v Arnab Roy>Ah.</v>

01:09:58.768 --> 01:10:01.301
For example,
if if the same patient wants to wants to

01:10:01.301 --> 01:10:04.208
have an appointment with another doctor
of the same hospital.

01:10:06.008 --> 01:10:06.108
<v Faisal Qayoom>So is it mandatory for him to have the Hu?</v>

01:10:06.108 --> 01:10:09.928
<v Arnab Roy>So see The Who the patient.</v>

01:10:11.838 --> 01:10:12.148
<v Arnab Roy>You're talking about the patient?</v>

01:10:12.148 --> 01:10:13.588
<v Faisal Qayoom>No, no, no, no.</v>

01:10:13.588 --> 01:10:13.868
<v Shankar S>No, no.</v>

01:10:13.868 --> 01:10:14.068
<v Faisal Qayoom>I'm talking about the expert.</v>

01:10:14.068 --> 01:10:17.285
See what is time to release?
Like if the same hospital,

01:10:17.285 --> 01:10:18.278
<v Shankar S>let's say 40s so 40s, has some doctor.</v>

01:10:18.278 --> 01:10:19.238
<v Faisal Qayoom>So for example.</v>

01:10:21.138 --> 01:10:22.018
<v Shankar S>Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.</v>

01:10:27.888 --> 01:10:28.408
<v Arnab Roy>OK.</v>

01:10:32.168 --> 01:10:32.648
<v Arnab Roy>OK.</v>

01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:37.874
So where actually they will onboard the
those doctors. For example,

01:10:37.874 --> 01:10:41.511
if I'm a patient,
I want an appointment with the with a

01:10:41.511 --> 01:10:43.978
<v Faisal Qayoom>different doctor in the same hospital.</v>

01:10:44.818 --> 01:10:45.858
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK, now.</v>

01:10:46.098 --> 01:10:46.978
<v Faisal Qayoom>Now I'll search in.</v>

01:10:47.018 --> 01:10:49.698
<v Faisal Qayoom>Search that doctor in the Hu.</v>

01:10:51.208 --> 01:10:51.288
Why are you searching for the doctor in
Hu?

01:10:51.288 --> 01:10:51.488
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK.</v>

01:10:52.808 --> 01:10:54.648
<v Arnab Roy>You should search for the doctor in th.</v>

01:10:57.018 --> 01:10:57.298
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK.</v>

01:10:57.298 --> 01:10:57.818
<v Faisal Qayoom>So is it?</v>

01:10:57.818 --> 01:11:01.178
Is it like the TA doctors are different
than the actual doctors?

01:11:01.178 --> 01:11:02.258
No, no. Th doctors are ex Hu.
Doctors only so, but OK, see.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.338
<v Faisal Qayoom>I'm getting a bit confused.</v>

01:11:06.488 --> 01:11:09.950
Right now,
forget about the fact that individual

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:11.928
<v Arnab Roy>doctors can join th and all.</v>

01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:13.608
<v Arnab Roy>No, cannot for now.</v>

01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:19.710
Now it is Hu.
Doctors get into th and onboard their

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:20.768
<v Arnab Roy>hospitals.</v>

01:11:20.768 --> 01:11:22.368
<v Arnab Roy>And then become a part of their hospital.</v>

01:11:22.728 --> 01:11:26.074
Either they get access to the hospital
admin, or if it's a doctor.

01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:28.571
That's why I wanted you guys to see this
process.

01:11:28.571 --> 01:11:31.168
This process was important to understand
that part.

01:11:32.838 --> 01:11:33.088
<v Arnab Roy>So basically what happens in.</v>

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:33.478
<v Shankar S>Then it's better.</v>

01:11:33.478 --> 01:11:34.318
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK. We will discuss it later.</v>

01:11:34.318 --> 01:11:35.398
<v Arnab Roy>What happens in this process?</v>

01:11:35.398 --> 01:11:36.998
<v Arnab Roy>I'll just give you a very short brief.</v>

01:11:36.998 --> 01:11:37.158
<v Arnab Roy>It's it's not that complex.</v>

01:11:37.158 --> 01:11:37.478
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK.</v>

01:11:37.478 --> 01:11:38.198
<v Faisal Qayoom>Yeah, yeah, sure.</v>

01:11:39.318 --> 01:11:43.643
See The thing is in out here we decide
whether the doctor himself is the one

01:11:43.643 --> 01:11:44.878
<v Arnab Roy>doing these additions.</v>

01:11:45.078 --> 01:11:47.678
<v Arnab Roy>He, the main administrator person.</v>

01:11:47.838 --> 01:11:53.318
So the reason this is this is happening
is because we have chain hospitals, right?

01:11:53.598 --> 01:11:57.038
Like Apollo Doctor coming and adding his
chain hospital.

01:11:57.038 --> 01:12:00.766
So in a chain hospital scenario,
the doctor himself does not do all the

01:12:00.766 --> 01:12:05.116
additions of the hospital information and
all he sends a link to some administrator

01:12:05.116 --> 01:12:06.358
<v Arnab Roy>and that person does it.</v>

01:12:06.638 --> 01:12:10.636
But there are also some smaller, smaller.
What do you call it?

01:12:10.636 --> 01:12:12.158
<v Arnab Roy>Medical clinics and all.</v>

01:12:12.318 --> 01:12:13.198
<v Arnab Roy>But the doctor himself.</v>

01:12:13.198 --> 01:12:16.290
Only creates a profile and does
everything,

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:20.857
so if a doctor himself creates this
profile and all, he adds it,

01:12:20.857 --> 01:12:26.268
he becomes the administrator of the
hospital and then after he finishes this

01:12:26.268 --> 01:12:29.078
<v Arnab Roy>hospital registration things he's given.</v>

01:12:30.648 --> 01:12:34.415
Access this is this is a scenario where
the doctor himself is doing the admin

01:12:34.415 --> 01:12:36.008
<v Arnab Roy>things. He gets access into this.</v>

01:12:37.688 --> 01:12:40.808
<v Arnab Roy>Medical Hospital this hospital admin.</v>

01:12:42.408 --> 01:12:43.928
<v Arnab Roy>And then he can add doctors out here.</v>

01:12:45.688 --> 01:12:46.008
<v Arnab Roy>Based on.</v>

01:12:47.648 --> 01:12:52.320
Other doctors in his clinic and all he
does not search for Doctor,

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.688
he does not search for hospitals or
specific hospital related doctors in Hu.

01:12:58.278 --> 01:12:59.878
<v Arnab Roy>In Hu, we just have the tag.</v>

01:13:01.448 --> 01:13:04.368
For getting th services and all he gets
into th and searches.

01:13:07.268 --> 01:13:08.158
<v Shankar S>I think it's too much.</v>

01:13:08.158 --> 01:13:09.638
<v Faisal Qayoom>So the onboarding Dr.</v>

01:13:10.068 --> 01:13:10.278
<v Arnab Roy>Wait, wait, wait.</v>

01:13:10.278 --> 01:13:12.918
So will he be able to log in the
onboarded Dr.

01:13:14.798 --> 01:13:16.038
<v Faisal Qayoom>Directly in the th.</v>

01:13:16.918 --> 01:13:20.148
Ah,
he gets he gets assigned this because in

01:13:20.148 --> 01:13:25.243
that scenario he's a small time doctor
with a clinic, so he has to do.

01:13:25.243 --> 01:13:30.841
He'll get access to his hospital at Admin
dashboard as well as his own doctor

01:13:30.841 --> 01:13:31.558
<v Arnab Roy>dashboard.</v>

01:13:32.278 --> 01:13:37.640
He'll get the logins too,
but in another scenario a doctor just

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.158
<v Arnab Roy>adds comes on to th. He adds his hospital.</v>

01:13:42.638 --> 01:13:44.758
<v Arnab Roy>Yeah, the mid chain hospital or something?</v>

01:13:44.758 --> 01:13:49.154
And he had some lead contact information,
then the hospital own and hospital.

01:13:49.154 --> 01:13:53.775
Only then adds the doctor and the doctor
automatically gets added to the profile.

01:13:53.775 --> 01:13:54.958
<v Arnab Roy>And like that, Hu is.</v>

01:13:55.238 --> 01:13:59.389
So you guys don't don't mix both,
that is why I'm constantly telling you

01:13:59.389 --> 01:14:03.994
don't think about mixing both because you
guys are gonna get into this confusion

01:14:03.994 --> 01:14:04.278
<v Arnab Roy>that.</v>

01:14:08.638 --> 01:14:09.458
<v Arnab Roy>Doctors at their hospitals. It's that's.</v>

01:14:09.458 --> 01:14:14.878
OK. OK. Adnan, last question,
last question.

01:14:15.598 --> 01:14:19.408
No, you clear what? Get up. He's name.
Whoa, that's it.

01:14:19.408 --> 01:14:19.608
<v Faisal Qayoom>So.</v>

01:14:22.368 --> 01:14:27.528
So now at the hospital,
admin has onboarded some doctors.

01:14:29.928 --> 01:14:30.208
<v Faisal Qayoom>He has.</v>

01:14:30.688 --> 01:14:32.208
<v Faisal Qayoom>They have onboarded Dr. A.</v>

01:14:33.508 --> 01:14:34.008
<v Arnab Roy>OK.</v>

01:14:34.008 --> 01:14:36.448
<v Faisal Qayoom>Doctor, a health profile.</v>

01:14:41.438 --> 01:14:46.268
How that part we're going to handle that.
We are going to have a doctor, 10 doctors.

01:14:46.268 --> 01:14:46.828
<v Arnab Roy>Nay, I'll be home.</v>

01:14:46.828 --> 01:14:48.488
<v Arnab Roy>Look, nay, allow Karen if her boling.</v>

01:14:48.488 --> 01:14:48.968
<v Faisal Qayoom>Work.</v>

01:14:52.718 --> 01:14:54.518
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK. TK, we will remember that.</v>

01:14:55.328 --> 01:14:57.128
<v Arnab Roy>Future me to future.</v>

01:14:58.728 --> 01:15:00.611
Me,
we have to create us because the doctor

01:15:00.611 --> 01:15:01.808
<v Arnab Roy>is specially coming into th.</v>

01:15:01.808 --> 01:15:03.088
<v Arnab Roy>He's not part of Hu.</v>

01:15:05.528 --> 01:15:10.688
So eventually there will be a fine day
when Hu.

01:15:12.248 --> 01:15:13.688
<v Arnab Roy>Th doctors will come separately.</v>

01:15:13.688 --> 01:15:16.208
They will not come via Hu or something
like that, right?

01:15:18.368 --> 01:15:21.798
<v Arnab Roy>What happens then is the thing.</v>

01:15:24.248 --> 01:15:24.528
<v Arnab Roy>Right now.</v>

01:15:24.528 --> 01:15:25.168
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK.</v>

01:15:25.168 --> 01:15:25.368
<v Faisal Qayoom>I got it.</v>

01:15:25.368 --> 01:15:27.608
<v Arnab Roy>Right now, yes, you're correct.</v>

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:29.688
Like we cannot do that because there's a
block, right?

01:15:29.688 --> 01:15:32.808
We cannot have doctor profile separately.
We are syncing no.

01:15:33.848 --> 01:15:39.199
Then then why we are adding the doctors
in the hospital if we if the patient

01:15:39.199 --> 01:15:42.048
<v Faisal Qayoom>cannot go to his profile or if he cannot?</v>

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:42.848
<v Arnab Roy>No, he can't go.</v>

01:15:42.848 --> 01:15:43.568
No,
like he's he's he's already a part of Hu,

01:15:43.568 --> 01:15:44.208
<v Faisal Qayoom>Log in to profile.</v>

01:15:44.901 --> 01:15:45.168
<v Arnab Roy>right?</v>

01:15:45.168 --> 01:15:47.768
<v Arnab Roy>He's the that profile gets synced into th.</v>

01:15:49.408 --> 01:15:51.728
<v Arnab Roy>And the relevant fields you know fill up.</v>

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:57.108
OK, OK. So that means in short,
he can only add the doctor.

01:15:57.108 --> 01:15:57.668
<v Faisal Qayoom>So he can.</v>

01:15:57.668 --> 01:16:02.808
The admin can only onboard the doctors
that that already has an account with Dhu.

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:04.048
<v Arnab Roy>Yeah, for now, yes.</v>

01:16:04.088 --> 01:16:04.264
Yeah, for now. Yes,
that is the main thing for now.

01:16:04.264 --> 01:16:05.068
<v Faisal Qayoom>So OK, OK.</v>

01:16:07.408 --> 01:16:07.608
<v Arnab Roy>We cannot add other externally.</v>

01:16:07.608 --> 01:16:07.688
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK.</v>

01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:11.208
<v Arnab Roy>Now who knows?</v>

01:16:11.248 --> 01:16:13.288
<v Arnab Roy>Arpan might take a call on that.</v>

01:16:14.848 --> 01:16:17.768
But we any which ways.
There are designs for both.

01:16:17.768 --> 01:16:19.968
Yes,
he will have to take the call on that.

01:16:19.968 --> 01:16:22.208
<v Arnab Roy>Both scenario that that call I can't take.</v>

01:16:22.208 --> 01:16:23.528
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah.</v>

01:16:25.908 --> 01:16:26.228
Whether you're doing it like that as see
from what I'm thinking,

01:16:26.228 --> 01:16:26.508
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK.</v>

01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:32.228
based on our discussions also,
we have to keep things a little separate.

01:16:33.808 --> 01:16:37.888
There's too much syncing is causing
confusion.

01:16:38.698 --> 01:16:40.268
I think only the login part and the and
then the back end.

01:16:40.268 --> 01:16:42.111
<v Faisal Qayoom>I think there will be, there will be.</v>

01:16:42.111 --> 01:16:44.208
The database should be like you know,
not different to has to be same.

01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:44.248
<v Faisal Qayoom>A.</v>

01:16:48.238 --> 01:16:48.278
<v Tanya>I.</v>

01:16:48.278 --> 01:16:49.958
<v Tanya>I mean, I I don't have to be separate.</v>

01:16:49.958 --> 01:16:50.908
<v Tanya>That's all.</v>

01:16:50.908 --> 01:16:53.668
Yeah, appajit, nevi doctors. Sublog,
H UK partial.

01:16:53.988 --> 01:16:57.914
Think of it in that way.
Everyone all of them are part of Hu

01:16:57.914 --> 01:16:58.428
<v Arnab Roy>already.</v>

01:16:59.968 --> 01:17:02.463
For now,
but we can't sustain this in the long

01:17:02.463 --> 01:17:02.728
<v Arnab Roy>term.</v>

01:17:03.368 --> 01:17:08.719
We have to keep registrations open for
both to come separately.

01:17:08.719 --> 01:17:12.398
Also 'cause just like patient's,
they will.

01:17:12.398 --> 01:17:14.618
They might also be doctors who are like,
I don't want to be a part of.

01:17:14.618 --> 01:17:15.658
<v Tanya>Yeah, exactly.</v>

01:17:16.185 --> 01:17:17.678
<v Arnab Roy>Hui want to be a part of TH.</v>

01:17:17.798 --> 01:17:20.812
So at that point of time,
you can't just turn them away.

01:17:20.812 --> 01:17:22.398
<v Arnab Roy>You're losing a customer then.</v>

01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:25.658
<v Tanya>Exactly.</v>

01:17:26.158 --> 01:17:29.499
So we can't decide right now.
That is a business decision. Again,

01:17:29.499 --> 01:17:31.118
<v Arnab Roy>our prone has to take that call.</v>

01:17:38.178 --> 01:17:39.198
<v Arnab Roy>Orca. Anything else?</v>

01:17:39.198 --> 01:17:39.678
<v Faisal Qayoom>OK.</v>

01:17:44.498 --> 01:17:44.738
<v Faisal Qayoom>Hey, Dania, you can.</v>

01:17:44.738 --> 01:17:46.058
<v Shankar S>I'm good for this call from now.</v>

01:17:46.538 --> 01:17:47.188
You can write these points like whatever
you have mentioned that arpan will take a

01:17:47.188 --> 01:17:47.468
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:17:51.071 --> 01:17:51.828
call so you can send these points to
Arvind or you can discuss with him once

01:17:51.828 --> 01:17:55.276
Yeah, yeah. For now,
I think mainly that was there.

01:17:55.276 --> 01:17:55.658
<v Faisal Qayoom>please.</v>

01:17:57.548 --> 01:18:00.708
See Arpan's main thing was he wanted to
merge everything, but then.

01:18:01.048 --> 01:18:02.248
Probably.
And then we can discuss with him.

01:18:02.248 --> 01:18:05.151
You, you,
you guys have to tell artanki everything.

01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:06.348
<v Arnab Roy>Merging is gonna be a little confusing.</v>

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:07.958
<v Tanya>Yeah. Yeah, exactly.</v>

01:18:07.958 --> 01:18:08.158
<v Shankar S>Mm hmm.</v>

01:18:08.168 --> 01:18:11.048
He wanted to merge everything he that's
what he also told me.

01:18:11.048 --> 01:18:13.803
Like,
why do we need to have treatment hospital

01:18:13.803 --> 01:18:15.008
<v Arnab Roy>separately like that?</v>

01:18:15.448 --> 01:18:18.398
But yes,
we can merge few things like I showed

01:18:18.398 --> 01:18:19.438
there are certain places we can show some
merged information.

01:18:19.438 --> 01:18:19.638
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

01:18:22.608 --> 01:18:27.048
<v Arnab Roy>There's part of Medicare hospital.</v>

01:18:28.128 --> 01:18:30.617
But then everywhere,
especially when it comes to the admins

01:18:30.617 --> 01:18:32.608
and all,
how are you gonna handle those things?

01:18:34.248 --> 01:18:38.398
<v Arnab Roy>It's gonna become really complicated.</v>

01:18:38.398 --> 01:18:38.908
<v Faisal Qayoom>So whatever things.</v>

01:18:38.908 --> 01:18:41.390
No,
we obviously after this discussion seems

01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:44.588
like it's very much clear that we can't
merge everything.

01:18:45.148 --> 01:18:46.068
<v Arnab Roy>We can't merge everything.</v>

01:18:47.028 --> 01:18:47.308
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:18:48.318 --> 01:18:52.685
Especially when it comes to, you know,
patients and also getting confused of

01:18:52.685 --> 01:18:53.668
what he's going with.
If every UI everything looks the same,

01:18:53.668 --> 01:18:54.188
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:18:56.145 --> 01:19:00.398
then they're they're never gonna realize
that they are another portal now.

01:19:01.608 --> 01:19:01.968
<v Tanya>No.</v>

01:19:03.098 --> 01:19:05.208
And Arnab, one more thing,
make sure Key will add any extra thing in

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:05.448
<v Arnab Roy>Ah.</v>

01:19:07.762 --> 01:19:10.938
the th for the user or for the export
profile.

01:19:13.088 --> 01:19:13.128
<v Arnab Roy>I.</v>

01:19:13.128 --> 01:19:13.288
<v Arnab Roy>I I didn't.</v>

01:19:13.978 --> 01:19:17.378
Abhi Abhi Agar expert and things in Abhi
10.7.

01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:20.928
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>
You will not add 11 points here in DTH.

01:19:22.918 --> 01:19:23.368
<v Faisal Qayoom>We profile many jovianna.</v>

01:19:23.368 --> 01:19:23.768
<v Shankar S>It can.</v>

01:19:23.768 --> 01:19:24.888
<v Shankar S>Harder. If later we can add them, yeah.</v>

01:19:24.888 --> 01:19:26.528
<v Arnab Roy>Navigation navigation Wiz.</v>

01:19:27.398 --> 01:19:28.718
<v Faisal Qayoom>Any navigation was.</v>

01:19:30.508 --> 01:19:30.648
<v Arnab Roy>The firkis.</v>

01:19:30.648 --> 01:19:36.848
Navigation was navigation wise KB or the
profile name has second name last name.

01:19:36.848 --> 01:19:41.487
Could you, for example,
if if not there in the Hu you will not

01:19:41.487 --> 01:19:43.328
<v Faisal Qayoom>add it in the th as well?</v>

01:19:44.548 --> 01:19:46.008
<v Arnab Roy>Aja, aja th.</v>

01:19:46.008 --> 01:19:47.568
<v Faisal Qayoom>What's capital file najobi?</v>

01:19:48.208 --> 01:19:53.866
Khalid account th because th does not
have much things like Hu Hu has too many

01:19:53.866 --> 01:19:59.380
things because they deal with a lot of
your podcast and then all his content

01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:04.034
content upload and all.
But those things are generally not there

01:20:04.034 --> 01:20:07.328
that much for Doctor Dashboard inside th
the.

01:20:07.328 --> 01:20:11.357
Hospital dashboard needs is very,
you know it has a lot of things,

01:20:11.357 --> 01:20:16.288
but the doctor dashboard of pH will not
have much things other than getting some.

01:20:17.288 --> 01:20:22.401
Information of giving him the ability to
jump to Hu dashboard or letting us know

01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:25.368
what is linked hospital is whether he
want to.

01:20:25.368 --> 01:20:27.048
<v Arnab Roy>He wants to change that linked hospital.</v>

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:32.832
He's not part of the hospital anymore,
so D link or something for those things,

01:20:32.832 --> 01:20:35.058
<v Arnab Roy>there will be some differences.</v>

01:20:35.128 --> 01:20:37.528
<v Arnab Roy>It can't be the exact same right pesal.</v>

01:20:37.528 --> 01:20:39.258
<v Faisal Qayoom>Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, that's it, see.</v>

01:20:39.258 --> 01:20:40.578
<v Arnab Roy>What about this changes over?</v>

01:20:40.578 --> 01:20:42.393
But yeah,
I understand what you're trying to say

01:20:42.393 --> 01:20:42.578
<v Arnab Roy>also.</v>

01:20:45.818 --> 01:20:49.258
See,
we are merging the data from Hu to th

01:20:49.258 --> 01:20:49.438
<v Faisal Qayoom>right not th Hu.</v>

01:20:49.438 --> 01:20:54.969
For you guys, like if you want me,
I can merge the Doctor dashboard of like

01:20:54.969 --> 01:20:59.844
th like the dashboard would have th stuff
Hu stuff and everything.

01:20:59.844 --> 01:21:02.288
But that is like kind of a nightmare,
right?

01:21:02.288 --> 01:21:06.126
Again, in that case,
it yeah for the doctor, if you want,

01:21:06.126 --> 01:21:11.486
would be really difficult to manage if
you can point was to keep it separate and

01:21:11.486 --> 01:21:13.008
<v Tanya>simple for the doctors.</v>

01:21:17.388 --> 01:21:23.226
I we can also do one thing like in the Hu
Doctor dashboard we have like 2 section

01:21:23.226 --> 01:21:27.618
side for the main the dashboard part we
can have one more section like yeah.

01:21:27.618 --> 01:21:28.778
<v Arnab Roy>Tishra tishra section.</v>

01:21:30.258 --> 01:21:32.258
<v Tanya>For for th you know for.</v>

01:21:32.258 --> 01:21:35.849
When I say I'm I want to merge,
I'm talking about that merging only,

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:36.328
<v Arnab Roy>like adding another tab.</v>

01:21:36.328 --> 01:21:38.808
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

01:21:38.888 --> 01:21:40.568
<v Tanya>How do you we should do that too?</v>

01:21:40.568 --> 01:21:41.838
<v Tanya>Only we can't merge everything.</v>

01:21:41.838 --> 01:21:42.678
<v Arnab Roy>Tab maybe?</v>

01:21:44.218 --> 01:21:47.536
The tab is different,
but inside the tab only I have to put all

01:21:47.536 --> 01:21:49.658
these navigations then tab key under
subtabogha subtab key under appointments

01:21:49.658 --> 01:21:49.858
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

01:21:51.579 --> 01:21:52.978
<v Arnab Roy>and separate patients list.</v>

01:21:53.498 --> 01:21:55.184
Shankar,
you guys have to tell whether that is

01:21:55.184 --> 01:21:56.618
<v Arnab Roy>feasible or no need separate drug there.</v>

01:21:57.318 --> 01:22:00.758
No, no, we'll keep it separate again.
Whole thing's merging.

01:22:01.118 --> 01:22:01.768
We'll create a complex because in the in
what we created, right?

01:22:01.768 --> 01:22:02.328
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:08.878
We have created in a structure ways in by
coding as well.

01:22:08.878 --> 01:22:14.188
When we merge it right it will be you
know too much messy things will happen

01:22:14.188 --> 01:22:18.118
there and then things will not go
according to our plan.

01:22:18.118 --> 01:22:18.318
So it seems to be simple,
but when it comes to an action.

01:22:18.318 --> 01:22:18.438
<v Arnab Roy>Hmm.</v>

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:28.215
Though things are like quite, you know,
complex and also makes too much confusion

01:22:28.215 --> 01:22:32.795
for doctor to have it and for the user
like who are is going through this

01:22:32.795 --> 01:22:33.278
<v Shankar S>application.</v>

01:22:33.278 --> 01:22:33.518
<v Arnab Roy>OK.</v>

01:22:33.518 --> 01:22:36.018
I think, Tanya,
you can do one thing like within this

01:22:36.018 --> 01:22:36.161
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:22:36.161 --> 01:22:37.678
<v Arnab Roy>time till before our next call.</v>

01:22:39.218 --> 01:22:43.458
Get the get these few points like from
like.

01:22:44.548 --> 01:22:44.828
<v Tanya>Help.</v>

01:22:45.258 --> 01:22:46.588
<v Arnab Roy>Hu Only Hu, doctors only come to th.</v>

01:22:46.588 --> 01:22:46.748
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:22:47.378 --> 01:22:50.928
I know that's what he told me.
But like everyone should be on the same

01:22:50.928 --> 01:22:51.578
<v Arnab Roy>page on this.</v>

01:22:52.448 --> 01:22:53.338
<v Tanya>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly.</v>

01:22:53.338 --> 01:22:56.337
Doctors do not create profiles on th
doctors,

01:22:56.337 --> 01:22:59.336
do not create profiles on th like
separately.

01:22:59.336 --> 01:23:00.028
Hu Doctors are the only ones who can go
to th that condition.

01:23:00.028 --> 01:23:00.228
<v Tanya>Mm hmm.</v>

01:23:02.528 --> 01:23:04.658
And also the elements cannot create the
new profiles.

01:23:04.658 --> 01:23:07.140
Yeah,
I was trying try to have a proper

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:07.298
<v Tanya>discussion on this like on everything.</v>

01:23:07.298 --> 01:23:10.618
<v Arnab Roy>Admins do not add for now, phase one may.</v>

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:13.838
Admins do not add fresh doctor profiles,
they add existing doctor profiles.

01:23:13.838 --> 01:23:14.278
<v Faisal Qayoom>Yes.</v>

01:23:15.338 --> 01:23:16.288
So via via member via member codes are
not recognized.

01:23:16.288 --> 01:23:16.528
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:23:19.498 --> 01:23:21.498
<v Arnab Roy>Doctor Profile found. Add doctor.</v>

01:23:21.498 --> 01:23:22.618
<v Arnab Roy>That's it for now. For now.</v>

01:23:22.618 --> 01:23:22.868
If he wants to add the new fresh doctor,
he has to create the profile in the Hu

01:23:22.868 --> 01:23:23.428
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:23:27.558 --> 01:23:27.918
<v Shankar S>and then he can add it.</v>

01:23:27.918 --> 01:23:29.838
Hey,
two unfortunately unfortunately this

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:30.278
<v Tanya>I need.</v>

01:23:30.469 --> 01:23:32.838
<v Arnab Roy>problem will be there in the beginning.</v>

01:23:33.358 --> 01:23:33.448
<v Arnab Roy>The people want to have th profiles.</v>

01:23:33.448 --> 01:23:33.568
<v Shankar S>Hmm.</v>

01:23:35.238 --> 01:23:36.518
<v Arnab Roy>They have to go via Hu.</v>

01:23:39.718 --> 01:23:44.438
Is arpan planning in the future to have
separate doctors separate hospitals?

01:23:44.438 --> 01:23:47.118
Not via Hu thing is that part of the plan
that you need to you need to get it sure

01:23:47.118 --> 01:23:50.398
<v Tanya>That all you have to discuss with him.</v>

01:23:50.638 --> 01:23:50.712
Yeah, yeah. Yes, I will have a discussion,
Anna. Yeah.

01:23:50.712 --> 01:23:56.759
from arpan that part key or is he gonna
be like you and Richa and then or or is

01:23:56.759 --> 01:23:57.968
<v Arnab Roy>he planning key?</v>

01:24:00.378 --> 01:24:01.818
<v Arnab Roy>If that is the case, then yes.</v>

01:24:02.098 --> 01:24:05.258
Well then eventually we'll have to keep
it separate.

01:24:05.258 --> 01:24:08.095
Because you know also,
as a Doctor Who you would not want to

01:24:08.095 --> 01:24:10.698
write this service like we do
consultation in anything.

01:24:10.698 --> 01:24:12.738
<v Tanya>They just want for the treatment.</v>

01:24:13.898 --> 01:24:14.298
<v Arnab Roy>Doctor.</v>

01:24:14.738 --> 01:24:17.078
Yeah,
we'll have to keep that option open for

01:24:17.078 --> 01:24:17.408
From my understanding,
I like to keep options open 'cause I know

01:24:17.408 --> 01:24:17.698
<v Tanya>that.</v>

01:24:20.298 --> 01:24:20.762
<v Tanya>Yeah, exactly.</v>

01:24:20.762 --> 01:24:24.468
if I design in a certain restrictive
manner I'll be stuck there only then

01:24:24.468 --> 01:24:24.955
<v Tanya>Exactly what time?</v>

01:24:24.955 --> 01:24:28.582
later on when options time comes,
I won't be able to, you know,

01:24:28.582 --> 01:24:32.038
change things much right now designs I
have that are pretty.

01:24:32.038 --> 01:24:33.638
Open-ended like I know there are things I
can add in between here and there.

01:24:33.638 --> 01:24:33.958
<v Tanya>Yeah.</v>

01:24:36.198 --> 01:24:37.998
Design is still open-ended in this in
this way.

01:24:37.998 --> 01:24:38.078
<v Tanya>Ar.</v>

01:24:40.818 --> 01:24:46.048
