00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Speaker 1: Welcome everyone to today's meeting. Let's begin with project updates.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Speaker 2: Sure! We have completed the first phase of development and are currently testing features. The initial results look promising, but there are still some edge cases we need to address.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:25.000
Speaker 3: Yes, during testing, we identified a few bugs in the login module and some inconsistencies in the data sync process. These need to be fixed before we move forward.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Speaker 1: Good to hear! Let's prioritize those fixes and aim for deployment next week. Do we have an estimated timeline for fixing these issues?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:45.000
Speaker 2: Most of the fixes should be completed by Wednesday. We'll then need a day for regression testing to ensure everything is stable.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:55.000
Speaker 3: Agreed. We should also update the documentation accordingly to reflect the latest changes and improvements. That way, the team can stay aligned.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Speaker 1: Great. Now, let's move to the next topic—our upcoming client presentation. Have we finalized the slides and prepared a demo?

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:15.000
Speaker 2: Yes, the slides are finalized, and the demo is fully functional. We should conduct a practice run tomorrow to refine our talking points and transitions.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:25.000
Speaker 3: That sounds good. We should also anticipate any potential questions from the client and prepare responses. I’ll draft a list of possible questions.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:35.000
Speaker 1: Excellent. That will help us stay prepared. Do we need to adjust any technical details in the demo?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:45.000
Speaker 2: The demo is in good shape, but we may need to optimize the database queries for smoother performance. I'll work on that before the practice session.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:55.000
Speaker 3: Good idea. We should also ensure that all the environment configurations match the client’s setup to avoid any surprises during the presentation.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:05.000
Speaker 1: Sounds good. Let's finalize the technical tweaks today so that tomorrow's practice run is productive. Moving on, do we have any updates on the new feature requests?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:15.000
Speaker 2: Yes, we received feedback from the stakeholders regarding additional reporting functionalities. They want more granular filtering options.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:25.000
Speaker 3: We can incorporate those filters into the reporting module. It shouldn’t take more than a week to implement once we finalize the specifications.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:35.000
Speaker 1: Let's review the requirements tomorrow after the client presentation rehearsal. That way, we can plan the development timeline accordingly.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:45.000
Speaker 2: Agreed. I'll prepare a summary of the requested features so we can go through them efficiently.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:55.000
Speaker 3: Perfect. I think that covers all our key topics for today. Anything else before we wrap up?

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.000
Speaker 1: No, I believe we are all set. Let's regroup tomorrow for the practice run and finalize the feature list. Thanks, everyone!
